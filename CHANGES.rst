Release 8.2.0 (in development)
==============================

Dependencies
------------

* #13000: Drop Python 3.10 support.

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* #13044: Remove the internal and undocumented ``has_equations`` data
  from the :py:class:`!MathDomain`` domain.
  The undocumented :py:meth:`!MathDomain.has_equations` method
  now unconditionally returns ``True``.
  These are replaced by the ``has_maths_elements`` key of the page context dict.
  Patch by Adam Turner.
* #13227: HTML output for sequences of keys in the :rst:role:`kbd` role
  no longer uses a ``<kbd class="kbd compound">`` element to wrap
  the keys and separators, but places them directly in the relevant parent node.
  This means that CSS rulesets targeting ``kbd.compound`` or ``.kbd.compound``
  will no longer have any effect.
  Patch by Adam Turner.

  Patch by James Addison.
