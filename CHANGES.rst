* #11970: singlehtml builder: make target URIs to be same-document references in
  the sense of :rfc:`RFC 3986, ยง4.4 <3986#section-4.4>`, e.g., ``index.html#foo``
  becomes ``#foo``. (note: continuation of a partial fix added in v7.3.0)

* #12514: intersphinx: fix the meaning of a negative value for
  :confval:`intersphinx_cache_limit`.

* #12730: The ``UnreferencedFootnotesDetector`` transform has been improved
  to more consistently detect unreferenced footnotes.
  Note, the priority of the transform has been changed from 200 to 622,
  so that it now runs after the docutils ``Footnotes`` resolution transform.
  Patch by Chris Sewell.
