  :confval:`intersphinx_cache_limit`.
  Patch by Shengyu Zhang.
* #12722: LaTeX: avoid TeX reporting ``Overfull \hbox`` from too long
  strings in a codeline when the problem has actually been solved thanks
  to :ref:`latexsphinxsetupforcewraps`.
  Patch by Jean-Fran√ßois B.

* #12730: The ``UnreferencedFootnotesDetector`` transform has been improved
  to more consistently detect unreferenced footnotes.
  Note, the priority of the transform has been changed from 200 to 622,
  so that it now runs after the docutils ``Footnotes`` resolution transform.
  Patch by Chris Sewell.
