Bugs fixed

  :confval:`intersphinx_cache_limit`.
  Patch by Shengyu Zhang.
* #12722: LaTeX: avoid TeX reporting ``Overfull \hbox`` from too long
  strings in a codeline when the problem has actually been solved thanks
  to :ref:`latexsphinxsetupforcewraps`.
  Patch by Jean-François B.
* #12730: The ``UnreferencedFootnotesDetector`` transform has been improved
  to more consistently detect unreferenced footnotes.
  Note, the priority of the transform has been changed from 200 to 622,
  so that it now runs after the docutils ``Footnotes`` resolution transform.
  Patch by Chris Sewell.
* #12778: LaTeX: let :ref:`'sphinxsetup' <latexsphinxsetup>`
  ``div.topic_box-shadow`` key if used with only one dimension set both

* #12587: Do not warn when potential ambiguity detected during Intersphinx

* #12717: LaTeX: let :option:`-q <sphinx-build -q>` (quiet) option for
  :program:`sphinx-build -M latexpdf` or :program:`make latexpdf` (``O=-q``)
  get passed to :program:`latexmk`.  Let :option:`-Q <sphinx-build -Q>`
  (silent) apply as well to the PDF build phase.
  Patch by Jean-François B.
* #12744: LaTeX: Classes injected by a custom interpreted text role now give
  rise to nested ``\DUrole``'s, rather than a single one with comma separated
  classes.
  Patch by Jean-François B.
* #11970, #12551: singlehtml builder: make target URIs to be same-document
  references in the sense of :rfc:`RFC 3986, §4.4 <3986#section-4.4>`,
  e.g., ``index.html#foo`` becomes ``#foo``.
  (note: continuation of a partial fix added in Sphinx 7.3.0)
  Patch by James Addison (with reference to prior work by Eric Norige)
* #12782: intersphinx: fix double forward slashes when generating the inventory

  even if they end with double forward slashes).
  Patch by Bénédikt Tran.

Testing
-------

* #12141: Migrate from the deprecated ``karma`` JavaScript test framework to
  the actively-maintained ``jasmine`` framework.  Test coverage is unaffected.
