Translation Progress
====================

When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,

I all alone beweep my outcast state,

And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,

And look upon myself, and curse my fate,

Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,

Featur’d like him, like him with friends possess’d,

Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,

With what I most enjoy contented least;

.. idempotent translations (2 out of 14 lines):

Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,

Haply I think on thee, and then my state,

.. untranslated (2 out of 14 lines):

Like to the lark at break of day arising

From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;

.. translation missing (2 out of 14 lines):

For thy sweet love remember’d such wealth brings

That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
