Versioning test text
====================

So the thing is I need some kind of text - not the lorem ipsum stuff, that
doesn't work out that well - to test :mod:`sphinx.versioning`. I couldn't find
a good text for that under public domain so I thought the easiest solution is
to write one by myself. It's not really interesting, in fact it is *really*
boring.

Anyway I need more

Anyway I need more than one paragraph, at least three for the original
document, I think, and another one for two different ones.

So the previous paragraph was a bit short because I don't want to test this
only on long paragraphs, I hope it was short enough to cover most stuff.
Anyway I see this lacks ``some markup`` so I have to add a **little** bit.
