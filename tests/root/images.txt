Sphinx image handling
=====================

.. first, a simple test with direct filename
.. image:: img.png

.. a non-existing image with direct filename
.. image:: foo.png

.. an image with path name (relative to this directory!)
.. image:: subdir/img.png
   :height: 100
   :width: 200

.. an image with unspecified extension
.. image:: img.*

.. a non-local image URI
.. image:: http://www.python.org/logo.png

.. an image with subdir and unspecified extension
.. image:: subdir/simg.*

.. an SVG image (for HTML at least)
.. image:: svgimg.*

.. an image with more than 1 dot in its file name
.. image:: img.foo.png
