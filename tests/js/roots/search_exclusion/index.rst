Main Page
=========

This is the main page of the ``search_exclusion`` test project.

This document is used as a test fixture to check that search results can be
filtered in the query by specifying excluded terms.

A term which starts with a hypen will be used as excluded term.

Include a second page which can be excluded in the search:
:index:`excluded`

is the pipeline flaky?
