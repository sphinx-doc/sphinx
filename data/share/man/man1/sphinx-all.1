.SS Getting Started
.sp
Sphinx is a \fIdocumentation generator\fP or a tool that translates a set of plain
text source files into various output formats, automatically producing
cross\-references, indices, etc.  That is, if you have a directory containing a
bunch of \fI\%reStructuredText\fP or \fI\%Markdown\fP
documents, Sphinx can generate a series of HTML files, a PDF file (via LaTeX),
man pages and much more.
.sp
Sphinx focuses on documentation, in particular handwritten documentation,
however, Sphinx can also be used to generate blogs, homepages and even books.
Much of Sphinx\(aqs power comes from the richness of its default plain\-text markup
format, \fI\%reStructuredText\fP, along with
its \fI\%significant extensibility capabilities\fP\&.
.sp
The goal of this document is to give you a quick taste of what Sphinx is and
how you might use it. When you\(aqre done here, you can check out the
\fI\%installation guide\fP followed by the intro to the
default markup format used by Sphinx, \fI\%reStructuredText\fP\&.
.sp
For a great \(dqintroduction\(dq to writing docs in general \-\- the whys and hows, see
also \X'tty: link https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/'\fI\%Write the docs\fP\X'tty: link', written by Eric Holscher.
.SS Setting up the documentation sources
.sp
The root directory of a Sphinx collection of plain\-text document sources is
called the \fI\%source directory\fP\&.  This directory also contains the Sphinx
configuration file \fBconf.py\fP, where you can configure all aspects of how
Sphinx reads your sources and builds your documentation.  [1]
.sp
Sphinx comes with a script called \fBsphinx\-quickstart\fP that sets up a
source directory and creates a default \fBconf.py\fP with the most useful
configuration values from a few questions it asks you. To use this, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
$ sphinx\-quickstart
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Defining document structure
.sp
Let\(aqs assume you\(aqve run \fBsphinx\-quickstart\fP\&.  It created a source
directory with \fBconf.py\fP and a root document, \fBindex.rst\fP\&.  The
main function of the \fI\%root document\fP is to serve as a welcome page, and
to contain the root of the \(dqtable of contents tree\(dq (or \fItoctree\fP).  This is one
of the main things that Sphinx adds to reStructuredText, a way to connect
multiple files to a single hierarchy of documents.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "reStructuredText directives"
.sp
\fBtoctree\fP is a reStructuredText \fIdirective\fP, a very versatile piece
of markup.  Directives can have arguments, options and content.
.sp
\fIArguments\fP are given directly after the double colon following the
directive\(aqs name.  Each directive decides whether it can have arguments, and
how many.
.sp
\fIOptions\fP are given after the arguments, in form of a \(dqfield list\(dq.  The
\fBmaxdepth\fP is such an option for the \fBtoctree\fP directive.
.sp
\fIContent\fP follows the options or arguments after a blank line.  Each
directive decides whether to allow content, and what to do with it.
.sp
A common gotcha with directives is that \fBthe first line of the content must
be indented to the same level as the options are\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBtoctree\fP directive initially is empty, and looks like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You add documents listing them in the \fIcontent\fP of the directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   usage/installation
   usage/quickstart
   ...
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is exactly how the \fBtoctree\fP for this documentation looks.  The
documents to include are given as \fI\%document name\fPs, which in short
means that you leave off the file name extension and use forward slashes
(\fB/\fP) as directory separators.
.sp
\fBSEE ALSO:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Read more about \fI\%the toctree directive\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can now create the files you listed in the \fBtoctree\fP and add content, and
their section titles will be inserted (up to the \fBmaxdepth\fP level) at the
place where the \fBtoctree\fP directive is placed.  Also, Sphinx now knows about
the order and hierarchy of your documents.  (They may contain \fBtoctree\fP
directives themselves, which means you can create deeply nested hierarchies if
necessary.)
.SS Adding content
.sp
In Sphinx source files, you can use most features of standard
\fI\%reStructuredText\fP\&.  There are also several features added by Sphinx.
For example, you can add cross\-file references in a portable way (which works
for all output types) using the \fI\%ref\fP role.
.sp
For an example, if you are viewing the HTML version, you can look at the source
for this document \-\- use the \(dqShow Source\(dq link in the sidebar.

.sp
.EX
$ sphinx\-build \-M html sourcedir outputdir
.EE
.UNINDENT

where \fIsourcedir\fP is the \fI\%source directory\fP, and \fIoutputdir\fP is the
directory in which you want to place the built documentation.
The \fI\%\-M\fP option selects a builder; in this example
Sphinx will build HTML files.

.SS Documenting objects
.sp
One of Sphinx\(aqs main objectives is easy documentation of \fIobjects\fP (in a
very general sense) in any \fIdomain\fP\&.  A domain is a collection of object
types that belong together, complete with markup to create and reference
descriptions of these objects.
.sp
The most prominent domain is the Python domain. For example, to document
Python\(aqs built\-in function \fBenumerate()\fP, you would add this to one of your
source files.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. py:function:: enumerate(sequence[, start=0])

   Return an iterator that yields tuples of an index and an item of the
   *sequence*. (And so on.)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is rendered like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B enumerate(sequence[, start=0])
Return an iterator that yields tuples of an index and an item of the
\fIsequence\fP\&. (And so on.)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The argument of the directive is the \fIsignature\fP of the object you
describe, the content is the documentation for it.  Multiple signatures can be
given, each in its own line.
.sp
The Python domain also happens to be the default domain, so you don\(aqt need to
prefix the markup with the domain name.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. function:: enumerate(sequence[, start=0])

   ...
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
does the same job if you keep the default setting for the default domain.
.sp
There are several more directives for documenting other types of Python
objects, for example \fI\%py:class\fP or \fI\%py:method\fP\&.  There is
also a cross\-referencing \fIrole\fP for each of these object types.  This
markup will create a link to the documentation of \fBenumerate()\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
The :py:func:\(gaenumerate\(ga function can be used for ...
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And here is the proof: A link to \fI\%enumerate()\fP\&.
.sp
Again, the \fBpy:\fP can be left out if the Python domain is the default one.  It
doesn\(aqt matter which file contains the actual documentation for
\fBenumerate()\fP; Sphinx will find it and create a link to it.
.sp
Each domain will have special rules for how the signatures can look like, and
make the formatted output look pretty, or add specific features like links to
parameter types, e.g. in the C/C++ domains.
.sp

.SS Basic configuration
.sp
Earlier we mentioned that the \fBconf.py\fP file controls how Sphinx
processes your documents.  In that file, which is executed as a Python source
file, you assign configuration values.  For advanced users: since it is
executed by Sphinx, you can do non\-trivial tasks in it, like extending
\X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path'\fI\%sys.path\fP\X'tty: link' or importing a module to find out the version you are
documenting.
.sp
The config values that you probably want to change are already put into the
\fBconf.py\fP by \fBsphinx\-quickstart\fP and initially commented out
(with standard Python syntax: a \fB#\fP comments the rest of the line).  To
change the default value, remove the hash sign and modify the value.  To
customize a config value that is not automatically added by
\fBsphinx\-quickstart\fP, just add an additional assignment.
.sp
Keep in mind that the file uses Python syntax for strings, numbers, lists and
so on.  The file is saved in UTF\-8 by default, as indicated by the encoding
declaration in the first line.

When documenting Python code, it is common to put a lot of documentation in the
source files, in documentation strings.  Sphinx supports the inclusion of
docstrings from your modules with an \fIextension\fP (an extension is a Python
module that provides additional features for Sphinx projects) called \fIautodoc\fP\&.

.SS Intersphinx
.sp
Many Sphinx documents including the \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3'\fI\%Python documentation\fP\X'tty: link' are published on
the Internet.  When you want to make links to such documents from your
documentation, you can do it with \fI\%sphinx.ext.intersphinx\fP\&.
.sp
In order to use intersphinx, you need to activate it in \fBconf.py\fP by
putting the string \fB\(aqsphinx.ext.intersphinx\(aq\fP into the \fI\%extensions\fP
list and set up the \fI\%intersphinx_mapping\fP config value.
.sp
For example, to link to \fBio.open()\fP in the Python library manual, you need to
setup your \fI\%intersphinx_mapping\fP like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
intersphinx_mapping = {\(aqpython\(aq: (\(aqhttps://docs.python.org/3\(aq, None)}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And now, you can write a cross\-reference like \fB:py:func:\(gaio.open\(ga\fP\&.  Any
cross\-reference that has no matching target in the current documentation set,
will be looked up in the documentation sets configured in
\fI\%intersphinx_mapping\fP (this needs access to the URL in order to
download the list of valid targets).  Intersphinx also works for some other
\fI\%domain\fP\(aqs roles including \fB:ref:\fP, however it doesn\(aqt work for
\fB:doc:\fP as that is non\-domain role.

===================================

**Lumache** (/lu\(aqmake/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers that
creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It pulls data from the \(gaOpen Food

.IP \(bu 2
an \fBinline external link\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
and a \fBnote\fP \fBadmonition\fP (one of the available \fI\%directives\fP)
.UNINDENT

Now to render it with the new content, you can use the \fBsphinx\-build\fP command
as before, or leverage the convenience script as follows:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
(.venv) $ cd docs
(.venv) $ make html
.EE
.UNINDENT

.sp
After running this command, you will see that \fBindex.html\fP reflects the new
changes!
.SS Building your documentation in other formats
.sp
Sphinx supports a variety of formats apart from HTML, including PDF, EPUB,
\fI\%and more\fP\&.  For example, to build your documentation
in EPUB format, run this command from the \fBdocs\fP directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
(.venv) $ make epub
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After that, you will see the files corresponding to the e\-book under
\fBdocs/build/epub/\fP\&.  You can either open \fBLumache.epub\fP with an
EPUB\-compatible e\-book viewer, like \X'tty: link https://calibre-ebook.com/'\fI\%Calibre\fP\X'tty: link',
or preview \fBindex.xhtml\fP on a web browser.

To quickly display a complete list of possible output formats, plus some
extra useful commands, you can run \fBmake help\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each output format has some specific configuration options that you can tune,
\fI\%including EPUB\fP\&.  For instance, the default value of
\fI\%epub_show_urls\fP is \fBinline\fP, which means that, by default, URLs are
shown right after the corresponding link, in parentheses.  You can change that
behavior by adding the following code at the end of your \fBconf.py\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# EPUB options
epub_show_urls = \(aqfootnote\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With this configuration value, and after running \fBmake epub\fP again, you will
notice that URLs appear now as footnotes, which avoids cluttering the text.

Generating a PDF using Sphinx can be done running \fBmake latexpdf\fP,
provided that the system has a working LaTeX installation,
as explained in the documentation of \fI\%sphinx.builders.latex.LaTeXBuilder\fP\&.
Although this is perfectly feasible, such installations are often big,
and in general LaTeX requires careful configuration in some cases,
so PDF generation is out of scope for this tutorial.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS More Sphinx customization
.sp
There are two main ways to customize your documentation beyond what is possible
with core Sphinx: extensions and themes.
.SS Enabling a built\-in extension
.sp
In addition to these configuration values, you can customize Sphinx even more
by using \fI\%extensions\fP\&.  Sphinx ships several
\fI\%builtin ones\fP, and there are many more
\fI\%maintained by the community\fP\&.
.sp
For example, to enable the \fI\%sphinx.ext.duration\fP extension,
locate the \fBextensions\fP list in your \fBconf.py\fP and add one element as
follows:
.sp
docs/source/conf.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named \(aqsphinx.ext.*\(aq) or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    \(aqsphinx.ext.duration\(aq,
]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After that, every time you generate your documentation, you will see a short
durations report at the end of the console output, like this one:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
(.venv) $ make html
\&...
The HTML pages are in build/html.

====================== slowest reading durations =======================
0.042 temp/source/index
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using a third\-party HTML theme
.sp
Themes, on the other hand, are a way to customize the appearance of your
documentation.  Sphinx has several \fI\%builtin themes\fP, and
there are also \X'tty: link https://sphinx-themes.org/'\fI\%third\-party ones\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
For example, to use the \X'tty: link https://pradyunsg.me/furo/'\fI\%Furo\fP\X'tty: link' third\-party theme
in your HTML documentation, first you will need to install it with \fBpip\fP in
your Python virtual environment, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
(.venv) $ pip install furo
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And then, locate the \fBhtml_theme\fP variable on your \fBconf.py\fP and replace
its value as follows:
.sp
docs/source/conf.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = \(aqfuro\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With this change, you will notice that your HTML documentation has now a new
appearance:

.sp
It is now time to \fI\%expand the narrative documentation and split it into
several documents\fP\&.
.SS Narrative documentation in Sphinx
.SS Structuring your documentation across multiple pages
.sp
The file \fBindex.rst\fP created by \fBsphinx\-quickstart\fP is the \fI\%root
document\fP, whose main function is to serve as a welcome page and to contain the
root of the \(dqtable of contents tree\(dq (or \fItoctree\fP).  Sphinx allows you to
assemble a project from different files, which is helpful when the project
grows.
.sp
As an example, create a new file \fBdocs/source/usage.rst\fP (next to
\fBindex.rst\fP) with these contents:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Usage

Installation
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

To use Lumache, first install it using pip:

\&.. code\-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install lumache
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This new file contains two \fI\%section\fP headers, normal
paragraph text, and a \fI\%code\-block\fP directive that renders
a block of content as source code, with appropriate syntax highlighting
(in this case, generic \fBconsole\fP text).
.sp
The structure of the document is determined by the succession of heading
styles, which means that, by using \fB\-\-\-\fP for the \(dqInstallation\(dq section
after \fB===\fP for the \(dqUsage\(dq section, you have declared \(dqInstallation\(dq to
be a \fIsubsection\fP of \(dqUsage\(dq.
.sp
To complete the process, add a \fBtoctree\fP \fI\%directive\fP at
the end of \fBindex.rst\fP including the document you just created, as follows:
.sp
docs/source/index.rst
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Adding cross\-references
.sp
One powerful feature of Sphinx is the ability to seamlessly add
\fI\%cross\-references\fP to specific parts of the documentation:
a document, a section, a figure, a code object, etc.  This tutorial is full of
them!
.sp
To add a cross\-reference, write this sentence right after the
introduction paragraph in \fBindex.rst\fP:
.sp
docs/source/index.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Check out the :doc:\(gausage\(ga section for further information.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%doc\fP \fI\%role\fP you used automatically
references a specific document in the project, in this case the \fBusage.rst\fP
you created earlier.
.sp
Alternatively, you can also add a cross\-reference to an arbitrary part of the
project. For that, you need to use the \fI\%ref\fP role, and add an
explicit \fIlabel\fP that acts as \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#hyperlink-targets'\fI\%a target\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
For example, to reference the \(dqInstallation\(dq subsection, add a label right
before the heading, as follows:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Usage
=====

\&.. _installation:

Installation
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\&...
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And make the sentence you added in \fBindex.rst\fP look like this:
.sp
docs/source/index.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Check out the :doc:\(gausage\(ga section for further information, including how to
:ref:\(gainstall <installation>\(ga the project.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Notice a trick here: the \fBinstall\fP part specifies how the link will look like
(we want it to be a specific word, so the sentence makes sense), whereas the
\fB<installation>\fP part refers to the actual label we want to add a
cross\-reference to. If you do not include an explicit title, hence using
\fB:ref:\(gainstallation\(ga\fP, the section title will be used (in this case,
\fBInstallation\fP). Both the \fB:doc:\fP and the \fB:ref:\fP roles will be rendered
as hyperlinks in the HTML documentation.
.sp
What about \fI\%documenting code objects in Sphinx\fP?
Read on!
.SS Describing code in Sphinx
.sp
In the \fI\%previous sections of the tutorial\fP you can read
how to write narrative or prose documentation in Sphinx. In this section you
will describe code objects instead.
.sp
Sphinx supports documenting code objects in several languages, namely Python,
C, C++, JavaScript, and reStructuredText. Each of them can be documented using
a series of directives and roles grouped by
\fI\%domain\fP\&. For the remainder of the
tutorial you will use the Python domain, but all the concepts seen in this
section apply for the other domains as well.
.SS Python
.SS Documenting Python objects
.sp
Sphinx offers several roles and directives to document Python objects,
all grouped together in \fI\%the Python domain\fP\&.
For example, you can use the \fI\%py:function\fP directive to document
a Python function, as follows:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Creating recipes
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

To retrieve a list of random ingredients,
you can use the \(ga\(galumache.get_random_ingredients()\(ga\(ga function:

\&.. py:function:: lumache.get_random_ingredients(kind=None)

   Return a list of random ingredients as strings.

   :param kind: Optional \(dqkind\(dq of ingredients.
   :type kind: list[str] or None
   :return: The ingredients list.
   :rtype: list[str]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Which will render like this:

Notice several things:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Sphinx parsed the argument of the \fB\&.. py:function\fP directive and
highlighted the module, the function name, and the parameters appropriately.
.IP \(bu 2
The directive content includes a one\-line description of the function,
as well as an \fI\%info field list\fP containing the function
parameter, its expected type, the return value, and the return type.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBpy:\fP prefix specifies the \fI\%domain\fP\&. You may configure the
default domain so you can omit the prefix, either globally using the
\fI\%primary_domain\fP configuration, or use the
\fI\%default\-domain\fP directive to change it from the point it is called
until the end of the file.
For example, if you set it to \fBpy\fP (the default), you can write
\fB\&.. function::\fP directly.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing Python objects
.sp
By default, most of these directives generate entities that can be
cross\-referenced from any part of the documentation by using
\fI\%a corresponding role\fP\&. For the case of functions,
you can use \fI\%py:func\fP for that, as follows:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
The \(ga\(gakind\(ga\(ga parameter should be either \(ga\(ga\(dqmeat\(dq\(ga\(ga, \(ga\(ga\(dqfish\(dq\(ga\(ga,
or \(ga\(ga\(dqveggies\(dq\(ga\(ga. Otherwise, :py:func:\(galumache.get_random_ingredients\(ga
will raise an exception.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When generating code documentation, Sphinx will generate a
cross\-reference automatically just by using the name of the object,
without you having to explicitly use a role for that. For example, you
can describe the custom exception raised by the function using the
\fI\%py:exception\fP directive:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. py:exception:: lumache.InvalidKindError

   Raised if the kind is invalid.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then, add this exception to the original description of the function:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. py:function:: lumache.get_random_ingredients(kind=None)

   Return a list of random ingredients as strings.

   :param kind: Optional \(dqkind\(dq of ingredients.
   :type kind: list[str] or None
   :raise lumache.InvalidKindError: If the kind is invalid.
   :return: The ingredients list.
   :rtype: list[str]
.EE
.UNINDENT

And finally, this is how the result would look:

Beautiful, isn\(aqt it?
.SS Including doctests in your documentation
.sp
Since you are now describing code from a Python library, it will become useful
to keep both the documentation and the code as synchronized as possible.
One of the ways to do that in Sphinx is to include code snippets in the
documentation, called \fIdoctests\fP, that are executed when the documentation is
built.
.sp
To demonstrate doctests and other Sphinx features covered in this tutorial,
Sphinx will need to be able to import the code. To achieve that, write this
at the beginning of \fBconf.py\fP:
.sp
docs/source/conf.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here.

An alternative to changing the \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path'\fI\%sys.path\fP\X'tty: link' variable is to create a
\fBpyproject.toml\fP file and make the code installable,
so it behaves like any other Python library. However, the \fBsys.path\fP
approach is simpler.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then, before adding doctests to your documentation, enable the
\fI\%doctest\fP extension in \fBconf.py\fP:
.sp
docs/source/conf.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
extensions = [
    \(aqsphinx.ext.duration\(aq,
    \(aqsphinx.ext.doctest\(aq,
]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Next, write a doctest block as follows:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
>>> import lumache
>>> lumache.get_random_ingredients()
[\(aqshells\(aq, \(aqgorgonzola\(aq, \(aqparsley\(aq]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Doctests include the Python instructions to be run preceded by \fB>>>\fP,
the standard Python interpreter prompt, as well as the expected output
of each instruction. This way, Sphinx can check whether the actual output
matches the expected one.
.sp
To observe how a doctest failure looks like (rather than a code error as
above), let\(aqs write the return value incorrectly first. Therefore, add a
function \fBget_random_ingredients\fP like this:
.sp
lumache.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
def get_random_ingredients(kind=None):
    return [\(dqeggs\(dq, \(dqbacon\(dq, \(dqspam\(dq]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can now run \fBmake doctest\fP to execute the doctests of your documentation.
Initially this will display an error, since the actual code does not behave
as specified:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
(.venv) $ make doctest

.UNINDENT
.sp
And finally, \fBmake doctest\fP reports success!
.sp
For big projects though, this manual approach can become a bit tedious.
In the next section, you will see \fI\%how to automate the
process\fP\&.
.SS Other languages (C, C++, others)
.SS Documenting and cross\-referencing objects
.sp
Sphinx also supports documenting and cross\-referencing objects written in
other programming languages. There are four additional built\-in domains:
C, C++, JavaScript, and reStructuredText. Third\-party extensions may
define domains for more languages, such as
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\X'tty: link https://sphinx-fortran.readthedocs.io'\fI\%Fortran\fP\X'tty: link',
.IP \(bu 2
\X'tty: link https://bastikr.github.io/sphinx-julia'\fI\%Julia\fP\X'tty: link', or
.IP \(bu 2
\X'tty: link https://github.com/markstory/sphinxcontrib-phpdomain'\fI\%PHP\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, to document a C++ type definition, you would use the built\-in
\fI\%cpp:type\fP directive, as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. cpp:type:: std::vector<int> CustomList

   A typedef\-like declaration of a type.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Which would give the following result:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B typedef std::vector<int> CustomList 
A typedef\-like declaration of a type.
.UNINDENT
.sp
All such directives then generate references that can be
cross\-referenced by using the corresponding role. For example, to reference
the previous type definition, you can use the \fI\%cpp:type\fP role
as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Cross reference to :cpp:type:\(gaCustomList\(ga.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Which would produce a hyperlink to the previous definition: \fI\%CustomList\fP\&.
.SS Automatic documentation generation from code
.sp
In the \fI\%previous section\fP of the tutorial
you manually documented a Python function in Sphinx. However, the description
was out of sync with the code itself, since the function signature was not
the same. Besides, it would be nice to reuse \X'tty: link https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/#what-is-a-docstring'\fI\%Python docstrings\fP\X'tty: link' in the documentation, rather than having to write
the information in two places.
.sp
Fortunately, \fI\%the autodoc extension\fP provides this
functionality.
.SS Reusing signatures and docstrings with autodoc
.sp
To use autodoc, first add it to the list of enabled extensions:
.sp
docs/source/conf.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
extensions = [
    \(aqsphinx.ext.duration\(aq,
    \(aqsphinx.ext.doctest\(aq,
    \(aqsphinx.ext.autodoc\(aq,
]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Next, move the content of the \fB\&.. py:function\fP directive to the function
docstring in the original Python file, as follows:
.sp
lumache.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
def get_random_ingredients(kind=None):
    \(dq\(dq\(dq
    Return a list of random ingredients as strings.

    :param kind: Optional \(dqkind\(dq of ingredients.
    :type kind: list[str] or None
    :raise lumache.InvalidKindError: If the kind is invalid.
    :return: The ingredients list.
    :rtype: list[str]

    \(dq\(dq\(dq
    return [\(dqshells\(dq, \(dqgorgonzola\(dq, \(dqparsley\(dq]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, replace the \fB\&.. py:function\fP directive from the Sphinx documentation
with \fI\%autofunction\fP:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
you can use the \(ga\(galumache.get_random_ingredients()\(ga\(ga function:

\&.. autofunction:: lumache.get_random_ingredients
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you now build the HTML documentation, the output will be the same!
With the advantage that it is generated from the code itself.
Sphinx took the reStructuredText from the docstring and included it,
also generating proper cross\-references.
.sp
You can also autogenerate documentation from other objects. For example, add
the code for the \fBInvalidKindError\fP exception:
.sp
lumache.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
class InvalidKindError(Exception):
    \(dq\(dq\(dqRaised if the kind is invalid.\(dq\(dq\(dq
    pass
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And replace the \fB\&.. py:exception\fP directive with \fI\%autoexception\fP
as follows:
.sp
docs/source/usage.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
or \(ga\(ga\(dqveggies\(dq\(ga\(ga. Otherwise, :py:func:\(galumache.get_random_ingredients\(ga
will raise an exception.

\&.. autoexception:: lumache.InvalidKindError
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And again, after running \fBmake html\fP, the output will be the same as before.
.SS Generating comprehensive API references
.sp
While using \fBsphinx.ext.autodoc\fP makes keeping the code and the documentation
in sync much easier, it still requires you to write an \fBauto*\fP directive
for every object you want to document. Sphinx provides yet another level of
automation: the \fI\%autosummary\fP extension.
.sp
The \fI\%autosummary\fP directive generates documents that contain all the
necessary \fBautodoc\fP directives. To use it, first enable the autosummary
extension:
.sp
docs/source/conf.py
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
extensions = [
   \(aqsphinx.ext.duration\(aq,
   \(aqsphinx.ext.doctest\(aq,
   \(aqsphinx.ext.autodoc\(aq,
   \(aqsphinx.ext.autosummary\(aq,
]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Next, create a new \fBapi.rst\fP file with these contents:
.sp
docs/source/api.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
API
===

\&.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

   lumache
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Remember to include the new document in the root toctree:
.sp
docs/source/index.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Contents
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\&.. toctree::

   usage
   api
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, after you build the HTML documentation running \fBmake html\fP, it will
contain two new pages:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBapi.html\fP, corresponding to \fBdocs/source/api.rst\fP and containing a table
with the objects you included in the \fBautosummary\fP directive (in this case,
only one).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBgenerated/lumache.html\fP, corresponding to a newly created reST file
\fBgenerated/lumache.rst\fP and containing a summary of members of the module,
in this case one function and one exception.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 2.5
[image: Summary page created by autosummary]
[image]
Summary page created by autosummary.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SS Appendix: Deploying a Sphinx project online
.sp
When you are ready to show your documentation project to the world, there are
many options available to do so. Since the HTML generated by Sphinx is static,
you can decouple the process of building your HTML documentation from hosting
such files in the platform of your choice. You will not need a sophisticated
server running Python: virtually every web hosting service will suffice.
.sp
Therefore, the challenge is less how or where to serve the static HTML, but
rather how to pick a workflow that automatically updates the deployed
documentation every time there is a change in the source files.
.sp
The following sections describe some of the available options to deploy
your online documentation, and give some background information. If you want
to go directly to the practical part, you can skip to \fI\%Publishing your documentation sources\fP\&.
.SS Sphinx\-friendly deployment options
.sp
There are several possible options you have to host your Sphinx documentation.
Some of them are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBRead the Docs\fP
\X'tty: link https://readthedocs.org/'\fI\%Read the Docs\fP\X'tty: link' is an online service specialized in hosting technical
documentation written in Sphinx, as well as MkDocs. They have a
number of extra features, such as versioned documentation, traffic and
search analytics, custom domains, user\-defined redirects, and more.
.TP
\fBGitHub Pages\fP
\X'tty: link https://pages.github.com/'\fI\%GitHub Pages\fP\X'tty: link' is a simple static web hosting tightly integrated with
\X'tty: link https://github.com/'\fI\%GitHub\fP\X'tty: link': static HTML is served from one of the branches of a project,
and usually sources are stored in another branch so that the output
can be updated every time the sources change (for example using \X'tty: link https://github.com/features/actions'\fI\%GitHub
Actions\fP\X'tty: link'). It is free to use and supports custom domains.
.TP
\fBGitLab Pages\fP
\X'tty: link https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/pages/'\fI\%GitLab Pages\fP\X'tty: link' is a similar concept to GitHub Pages, integrated with
\X'tty: link https://gitlab.com/'\fI\%GitLab\fP\X'tty: link' and usually automated with \X'tty: link https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/'\fI\%GitLab CI\fP\X'tty: link' instead.
.TP
\fBNetlify\fP
\X'tty: link https://www.netlify.com/'\fI\%Netlify\fP\X'tty: link' is a sophisticated hosting for static sites enhanced by
client\-side web technologies like JavaScript (so\-called \X'tty: link https://jamstack.org/'\fI\%\(dqJamstack\(dq\fP\X'tty: link').
They offer support for headless content management systems and
serverless computing.
.TP
\fBYour own server\fP
You can always use your own web server to host Sphinx HTML documentation.
It is the option that gives more flexibility, but also more complexity.
.UNINDENT
.sp
All these options have zero cost, with the option of paying for extra features.
.SS Embracing the \(dqDocs as Code\(dq philosophy
.sp
The free offerings of most of the options listed above require your
documentation sources to be publicly available. Moreover, these services
expect you to use a \X'tty: link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control'\fI\%Version Control System\fP\X'tty: link', a technology that tracks the
evolution of a collection of files as a series of snapshots (\(dqcommits\(dq).
The practice of writing documentation in plain text files with the same tools
as the ones used for software development is commonly known as \X'tty: link https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/'\fI\%\(dqDocs as Code\(dq\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
The most popular Version Control System nowadays is \X'tty: link https://git-scm.com/'\fI\%Git\fP\X'tty: link', a free and open
source tool that is the backbone of services like GitHub and GitLab.
Since both Read the Docs and Netlify have integrations with GitHub and GitLab,
and both GitHub and GitLab have an integrated Pages product, the most effective
way of automatically build your documentation online is to upload your sources
to either of these Git hosting services.
.SS Publishing your documentation sources
.SS GitHub
.sp
The quickest way to upload an existing project to GitHub is to:

consult the \X'tty: link https://docs.github.com/en/get-started'\fI\%official GitHub documentation\fP\X'tty: link'
.SS GitLab

.SS Publishing your HTML documentation
.SS Read the Docs
.sp
\X'tty: link https://readthedocs.org/'\fI\%Read the Docs\fP\X'tty: link' offers integration with both GitHub and GitLab. The quickest
way of getting started is to follow \X'tty: link https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html'\fI\%the RTD
tutorial\fP\X'tty: link', which is loosely based on this one.
You can publish your sources on GitHub as explained \fI\%in the previous

\X'tty: link https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html#creating-a-read-the-docs-account'\fI\%Creating a Read the Docs account\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
If you choose GitLab instead, the process is similar.
.SS GitHub Pages
.sp
\X'tty: link https://pages.github.com/'\fI\%GitHub Pages\fP\X'tty: link' requires you to \fI\%publish your
sources\fP on \X'tty: link https://github.com/'\fI\%GitHub\fP\X'tty: link'\&. After that, you will need an
automated process that performs the \fBmake html\fP step every time the sources
change. That can be achieved using \X'tty: link https://github.com/features/actions'\fI\%GitHub Actions\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp

documentation\fP\&.
.SH USER GUIDES
.sp
These sections cover various topics in using and extending Sphinx for various
use\-cases. They are a comprehensive guide to using Sphinx in many contexts and
assume more knowledge of Sphinx. If you are new to Sphinx, we recommend
starting with \fI\%Get started\fP\&.
.SS Using Sphinx
.sp
This guide serves to demonstrate how one can get started with Sphinx and covers
everything from installing Sphinx and configuring your first Sphinx project to
using some of the advanced features Sphinx provides out\-of\-the\-box. If you are
looking for guidance on extending Sphinx, refer to \fI\%Extending Sphinx\fP\&.
.SS reStructuredText
.sp
reStructuredText (reST) is the default plaintext markup language used by both
Docutils and Sphinx. Docutils provides the basic reStructuredText syntax, while
Sphinx extends this to support additional functionality.
.sp
The below guides go through the most important aspects of reST. For the
authoritative reStructuredText reference, refer to the \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html'\fI\%docutils
documentation\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS reStructuredText Primer
.sp
reStructuredText is the default plaintext markup language used by Sphinx.  This
section is a brief introduction to reStructuredText (reST) concepts and syntax,
intended to provide authors with enough information to author documents
productively.  Since reST was designed to be a simple, unobtrusive markup
language, this will not take too long.

.SS Paragraphs
.sp
The paragraph (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#paragraphs'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') is the most basic block in a reST
document.  Paragraphs are simply chunks of text separated by one or more blank
lines.  As in Python, indentation is significant in reST, so all lines of the
same paragraph must be left\-aligned to the same level of indentation.
.SS Inline markup
.sp
The standard reST inline markup is quite simple: use
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
one asterisk: \fB*text*\fP for emphasis (italics),
.IP \(bu 2
two asterisks: \fB**text**\fP for strong emphasis (boldface), and
.IP \(bu 2
backquotes: \fB\(ga\(gatext\(ga\(ga\fP for code samples.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If asterisks or backquotes appear in running text and could be confused with
inline markup delimiters, they have to be escaped with a backslash.
.sp
Be aware of some restrictions of this markup:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
it may not be nested,
.IP \(bu 2
content may not start or end with whitespace: \fB* text*\fP is wrong,
.IP \(bu 2
it must be separated from surrounding text by non\-word characters.  Use a
backslash escaped space to work around that: \fBthisis\e *one*\e word\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These restrictions may be lifted in future versions of the docutils.
.sp
It is also possible to replace or expand upon some of this inline markup with
roles. Refer to \fI\%Roles\fP for more information.
.SS Lists and Quote\-like blocks
.sp
List markup (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#bullet-lists'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') is natural: just place an asterisk at
the start of a paragraph and indent properly.  The same goes for numbered
lists; they can also be autonumbered using a \fB#\fP sign:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
* This is a bulleted list.
* It has two items, the second
  item uses two lines.

1. This is a numbered list.
2. It has two items too.

#. This is a numbered list.
#. It has two items too.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Nested lists are possible, but be aware that they must be separated from the
parent list items by blank lines:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
* this is
* a list

  * with a nested list
  * and some subitems

* and here the parent list continues
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Definition lists (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#definition-lists'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are created as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

   Definition of the term, which must be indented

   and can even consist of multiple paragraphs

next term

.EE
.UNINDENT

Note that the term cannot have more than one line of text.
.sp
Quoted paragraphs (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#block-quotes'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are created by just indenting
them more than the surrounding paragraphs.
.sp
Line blocks (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#line-blocks'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are a way of preserving line breaks:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

.SS Literal blocks
.sp
Literal code blocks (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#literal-blocks'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are introduced by ending a
paragraph with the special marker \fB::\fP\&.  The literal block must be indented
(and, like all paragraphs, separated from the surrounding ones by blank
lines):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
This is a normal text paragraph. The next paragraph is a code sample::

   It is not processed in any way, except
   that the indentation is removed.

   It can span multiple lines.

This is a normal text paragraph again.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The handling of the \fB::\fP marker is smart:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If it occurs as a paragraph of its own, that paragraph is completely left out
of the document.
.IP \(bu 2
If it is preceded by whitespace, the marker is removed.
.IP \(bu 2
If it is preceded by non\-whitespace, the marker is replaced by a single
colon.
.UNINDENT
.sp
That way, the second sentence in the above example\(aqs first paragraph would be
rendered as \(dqThe next paragraph is a code sample:\(dq.
.sp
Code highlighting can be enabled for these literal blocks on a document\-wide
basis using the \fI\%highlight\fP directive and on a project\-wide basis
using the \fI\%highlight_language\fP configuration option. The
\fI\%code\-block\fP directive can be used to set highlighting on a
block\-by\-block basis. These directives are discussed later.
.SS Doctest blocks
.sp
Doctest blocks (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#doctest-blocks'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are interactive Python sessions
cut\-and\-pasted into docstrings. They do not require the
\fI\%literal blocks\fP syntax. The doctest block must end
with a blank line and should \fInot\fP end with an unused prompt:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Tables
.sp
For \fIgrid tables\fP (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#grid-tables'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link'), you have to \(dqpaint\(dq the cell
grid yourself.  They look like this:

\fISimple tables\fP (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#simple-tables'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are easier to write, but
limited: they must contain more than one row, and the first column cells cannot
contain multiple lines.  They look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.EX

Two more syntaxes are supported: \fICSV tables\fP and \fIList tables\fP\&. They use an
\fIexplicit markup block\fP\&. Refer to \fI\%Tables\fP for more information.
.SS Hyperlinks
.SS External links
.sp
Use \fB\(gaLink text <https://domain.invalid/>\(ga_\fP for inline web links.  If the
link text should be the web address, you don\(aqt need special markup at all, the
parser finds links and mail addresses in ordinary text.
.sp

.SS Internal links
.sp
Internal linking is done via a special reST role provided by Sphinx, see the
section on specific markup, \fI\%Cross\-referencing arbitrary locations\fP\&.
.SS Sections
.sp
Section headers (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#sections'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are created by underlining (and
optionally overlining) the section title with a punctuation character, at least
as long as the text:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
=================
This is a heading
=================
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the
structure is determined from the succession of headings.  However, this
convention is used in \X'tty: link https://devguide.python.org/documentation/markup/#sections'\fI\%Python Developer\(aqs Guide for documenting\fP\X'tty: link' which you may
follow:
.INDENT 0.0

\fB#\fP with overline, for parts
.IP \(bu 2
\fB*\fP with overline, for chapters
.IP \(bu 2
\fB=\fP for sections
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\fP for subsections
.IP \(bu 2
\fB^\fP for subsubsections
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\(dq\fP for paragraphs
.UNINDENT
.sp
Of course, you are free to use your own marker characters (see the reST
documentation), and use a deeper nesting level, but keep in mind that most
target formats (HTML, LaTeX) have a limited supported nesting depth.
.SS Field Lists
.sp
Field lists (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#field-lists'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are sequences of fields marked up like
this:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Roles
.sp
A role or \(dqcustom interpreted text role\(dq (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/roles.html'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') is an inline
piece of explicit markup. It signifies that the enclosed text should be
interpreted in a specific way.  Sphinx uses this to provide semantic markup and
cross\-referencing of identifiers, as described in the appropriate section.  The
general syntax is \fB:rolename:\(gacontent\(ga\fP\&.
.sp
Docutils supports the following roles:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Explicit Markup
.sp
\(dqExplicit markup\(dq (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#explicit-markup-blocks'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') is used in reST for
most constructs that need special handling, such as footnotes,
specially\-highlighted paragraphs, comments, and generic directives.
.sp
An explicit markup block begins with a line starting with \fB\&..\fP followed by
whitespace and is terminated by the next paragraph at the same level of
indentation.  (There needs to be a blank line between explicit markup and
normal paragraphs.  This may all sound a bit complicated, but it is intuitive
enough when you write it.)
.SS Directives
.sp
A directive (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#directives'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') is a generic block of explicit markup.
Along with roles, it is one of the extension mechanisms of reST, and Sphinx
makes heavy use of it.

.sp
Directives added by Sphinx are described in \fI\%Directives\fP\&.
.sp
Basically, a directive consists of a name, arguments, options and content.
(Keep this terminology in mind, it is used in the next chapter describing
custom directives.)  Looking at this example,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. function:: foo(x)
              foo(y, z)
   :module: some.module.name

   Return a line of text input from the user.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBfunction\fP is the directive name.  It is given two arguments here, the
remainder of the first line and the second line, as well as one option
\fBmodule\fP (as you can see, options are given in the lines immediately
following the arguments and indicated by the colons).  Options must be indented
to the same level as the directive content.
.sp
The directive content follows after a blank line and is indented relative to
the directive start or if options are present, by the same amount as the
options.
.sp
Be careful as the indent is not a fixed number of whitespace, e.g. three, but
any number whitespace.  This can be surprising when a fixed indent is used
throughout the document and can make a difference for directives which are
sensitive to whitespace. Compare:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. code\-block::
   :caption: A cool example

       The output of this line starts with four spaces.

\&.. code\-block::

       The output of this line has no spaces at the beginning.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the first code block, the indent for the content was fixated by the option
line to three spaces, consequently the content starts with four spaces.
In the latter the indent was fixed by the content itself to seven spaces, thus
it does not start with a space.
.SS Images
.sp
reST supports an image directive (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#image'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link'), used like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. image:: gnu.png
   (options)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When used within Sphinx, the file name given (here \fBgnu.png\fP) must either be
relative to the source file, or absolute which means that they are relative to
the top source directory.  For example, the file \fBsketch/spam.rst\fP could
refer to the image \fBimages/spam.png\fP as \fB\&../images/spam.png\fP or
\fB/images/spam.png\fP\&.
.sp
Sphinx will automatically copy image files over to a subdirectory of the output
directory on building (e.g. the \fB_static\fP directory for HTML output.)
.sp
Interpretation of image size options (\fBwidth\fP and \fBheight\fP) is as follows:
if the size has no unit or the unit is pixels, the given size will only be
respected for output channels that support pixels. Other units (like \fBpt\fP for
points) will be used for HTML and LaTeX output (the latter replaces \fBpt\fP by
\fBbp\fP as this is the TeX unit such that \fB72bp=1in\fP).
.sp
Sphinx extends the standard docutils behavior by allowing an asterisk for the
extension:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. image:: gnu.*
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Sphinx then searches for all images matching the provided pattern and
determines their type.  Each builder then chooses the best image out of these
candidates.  For instance, if the file name \fBgnu.*\fP was given and two files
\fBgnu.pdf\fP and \fBgnu.png\fP existed in the source tree, the LaTeX
builder would choose the former, while the HTML builder would prefer the
latter.  Supported image types and choosing priority are defined at
\fI\%Builders\fP\&.
.sp
Note that image file names should not contain spaces.
.sp
Changed in version 0.4: Added the support for file names ending in an asterisk.

.sp
Changed in version 0.6: Image paths can now be absolute.

.sp
Changed in version 1.5: latex target supports pixels (default is \fB96px=1in\fP).

.SS Footnotes
.sp
For footnotes (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#footnotes'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link'), use \fB[#name]_\fP to mark the footnote
location, and add the footnote body at the bottom of the document after a
\(dqFootnotes\(dq rubric heading, like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Citations
.sp
Standard reST citations (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#citations'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link') are supported, with the
additional feature that they are \(dqglobal\(dq, i.e. all citations can be referenced
from all files.  Use them like so:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Lorem ipsum [Ref]_ dolor sit amet.

\&.. [Ref] Book or article reference, URL or whatever.
.EE
.UNINDENT

Citation usage is similar to footnote usage, but with a label that is not

.SS Substitutions
.sp
reST supports \(dqsubstitutions\(dq (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#substitution-definitions'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link'), which
are pieces of text and/or markup referred to in the text by \fB|name|\fP\&.  They
are defined like footnotes with explicit markup blocks, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

See the \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#substitution-definitions'\fI\%reST reference for substitutions\fP\X'tty: link'
for details.
.sp
If you want to use some substitutions for all documents, put them into
\fI\%rst_prolog\fP or \fI\%rst_epilog\fP or put them into a separate file
and include it into all documents you want to use them in, using the
\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#include'\fI\%include\fP\X'tty: link' directive.  (Be sure to give the include file a file name
extension differing from that of other source files, to avoid Sphinx finding it
as a standalone document.)
.sp
Sphinx defines some default substitutions, see \fI\%Substitutions\fP\&.
.SS Comments
.sp
Every explicit markup block which isn\(aqt a valid markup construct (like the
footnotes above) is regarded as a comment (\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#comments'\fI\%ref\fP\X'tty: link').  For

.SS HTML Metadata
.sp
The \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#meta'\fI\%meta\fP\X'tty: link' directive allows specifying the HTML
\X'tty: link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta'\fI\%metadata element\fP\X'tty: link' of a Sphinx documentation page.  For example, the
directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. meta::
   :description: The Sphinx documentation builder
   :keywords: Sphinx, documentation, builder
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will generate the following HTML output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
<meta name=\(dqdescription\(dq content=\(dqThe Sphinx documentation builder\(dq>
<meta name=\(dqkeywords\(dq content=\(dqSphinx, documentation, builder\(dq>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Also, Sphinx will add the keywords as specified in the meta directive to the
search index.  Thereby, the \fBlang\fP attribute of the meta element is
considered.  For example, the directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. meta::
   :keywords: backup
   :keywords lang=en: pleasefindthiskey pleasefindthiskeytoo

\fBpleasefindthiskey\fP, \fBpleasefindthiskeytoo\fP to \fIEnglish\fP builds;
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbittediesenkeyfinden\fP to \fIGerman\fP builds;
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbackup\fP to builds in all languages.
.UNINDENT
.SS Source encoding
.sp
Since the easiest way to include special characters like em dashes or copyright
signs in reST is to directly write them as Unicode characters, one has to
specify an encoding.  Sphinx assumes source files to be encoded in UTF\-8 by
default; you can change this with the \fI\%source_encoding\fP config value.
.SS Gotchas
.sp
There are some problems one commonly runs into while authoring reST documents:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBSeparation of inline markup:\fP As said above, inline markup spans must be
separated from the surrounding text by non\-word characters, you have to use a
backslash\-escaped space to get around that.  See \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#substitution-definitions'\fI\%the reference\fP\X'tty: link' for the details.

To enable syntax highlighting, you must first use the Docutils \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#role'\fI\%role\fP\X'tty: link'
directive to define a custom role associated with a specific language:

those created using \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses'\fI\%curses\fP\X'tty: link' or other text\-based libraries.  Any label
used in the interface should be marked with this role, including button
labels, window titles, field names, menu and menu selection names, and even
values in selection lists.
.sp
Changed in version 1.0: An accelerator key for the GUI label can be included using an ampersand;
this will be stripped and displayed underlined in the output (for example:
\fB:guilabel:\(ga&Cancel\(ga\fP displays Cancel).  To include a literal
ampersand, double it.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :kbd:
Mark a sequence of keystrokes.  What form the key sequence takes may depend
on platform\- or application\-specific conventions.  When there are no
relevant conventions, the names of modifier keys should be spelled out, to
improve accessibility for new users and non\-native speakers.  For example,
an \fIxemacs\fP key sequence may be marked like \fB:kbd:\(gaC\-x C\-f\(ga\fP, but without
reference to a specific application or platform, the same sequence should be
marked as \fB:kbd:\(gaControl\-x Control\-f\(ga\fP, displaying \fBC\-x C\-f\fP and
\fBControl\-x Control\-f\fP respectively.
.UNINDENT

.B :mailheader:
The name of an RFC 822\-style mail header.  This markup does not imply that
the header is being used in an email message, but can be used to refer to
any header of the same \(dqstyle.\(dq  This is also used for headers defined by
the various MIME specifications.  The header name should be entered in the
same way it would normally be found in practice, with the camel\-casing
conventions being preferred where there is more than one common usage. For
example: \fB:mailheader:\(gaContent\-Type\(ga\fP displays \fIContent\-Type\fP\&.

.B :menuselection:
Menu selections should be marked using the \fBmenuselection\fP role.  This is
used to mark a complete sequence of menu selections, including selecting
submenus and choosing a specific operation, or any subsequence of such a
sequence.  The names of individual selections should be separated by
\fB\-\->\fP\&.
.sp
For example, to mark the selection \(dqStart > Programs\(dq, use this markup:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
:menuselection:\(gaStart \-\-> Programs\(ga
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

When including a selection that includes some trailing indicator, such as
the ellipsis some operating systems use to indicate that the command opens a

A piece of literal text, such as code.  Within the contents, you can use
curly braces to indicate a \(dqvariable\(dq part, as in \fI\%file\fP\&.  For
example, in \fB:samp:\(gaprint(1+{variable})\(ga\fP, the part \fBvariable\fP would be
emphasized: \fBprint(1+\fP\fIvariable\fP\fB)\fP
.sp
If you don\(aqt need the \(dqvariable part\(dq indication, use the standard
\fI\%code\fP role instead.

.SS Directives
.sp
\fI\%As previously discussed\fP, a directive is a generic block

.SS Table of contents
.sp
Since reST does not have facilities to interconnect several documents, or split
documents into multiple output files, Sphinx uses a custom directive to add
relations between the single files the documentation is made of, as well as
tables of contents.  The \fBtoctree\fP directive is the central element.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Simple \(dqinclusion\(dq of one file in another can be done with the

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. toctree::
This directive inserts a \(dqTOC tree\(dq at the current location, using the
individual TOCs (including \(dqsub\-TOC trees\(dq) of the documents given in the
directive body.  Relative document names (not beginning with a slash) are
relative to the document the directive occurs in, absolute names are relative
to the source directory.  A numeric \fBmaxdepth\fP option may be given to
indicate the depth of the tree; by default, all levels are included. [1]
.sp
The representation of \(dqTOC tree\(dq is changed in each output format.  The
builders that output multiple files (ex. HTML) treat it as a collection of
hyperlinks.  On the other hand, the builders that output a single file (ex.
LaTeX, man page, etc.) replace it with the content of the documents on the
TOC tree.
.sp
Consider this example (taken from the Python docs\(aq library reference index):
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   intro
   strings
   datatypes
   numeric
   (many more documents listed here)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This accomplishes two things:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Tables of contents from all those documents are inserted, with a maximum
depth of two, that means one nested heading.  \fBtoctree\fP directives in
those documents are also taken into account.
.IP \(bu 2
Sphinx knows the relative order of the documents \fBintro\fP,
\fBstrings\fP and so forth, and it knows that they are children of the shown
document, the library index.  From this information it generates \(dqnext
chapter\(dq, \(dqprevious chapter\(dq and \(dqparent chapter\(dq links.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBEntries\fP
.sp
Document titles in the \fI\%toctree\fP will be automatically read from the
title of the referenced document. If that isn\(aqt what you want, you can
specify an explicit title and target using a similar syntax to reST
hyperlinks (and Sphinx\(aqs \fI\%cross\-referencing syntax\fP). This
looks like:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::

   intro
   All about strings <strings>
   datatypes
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The second line above will link to the \fBstrings\fP document, but will use the
title \(dqAll about strings\(dq instead of the title of the \fBstrings\fP document.
.sp
You can also add external links, by giving an HTTP URL instead of a document
name.
.sp
\fBSection numbering\fP
.sp
If you want to have section numbers even in HTML output, give the
\fBtoplevel\fP toctree a \fBnumbered\fP option.  For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :numbered:

   foo
   bar
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Numbering then starts at the heading of \fBfoo\fP\&.  Sub\-toctrees are
automatically numbered (don\(aqt give the \fBnumbered\fP flag to those).
.sp
Numbering up to a specific depth is also possible, by giving the depth as a
numeric argument to \fBnumbered\fP\&.
.sp
\fBAdditional options\fP
.sp
You can use the \fBcaption\fP option to provide a toctree caption and you can
use the \fBname\fP option to provide an implicit target name that can be
referenced by using \fI\%ref\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :caption: Table of Contents
   :name: mastertoc

   foo
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you want only the titles of documents in the tree to show up, not other
headings of the same level, you can use the \fBtitlesonly\fP option:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   foo
   bar
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can use \(dqglobbing\(dq in toctree directives, by giving the \fBglob\fP flag
option.  All entries are then matched against the list of available
documents, and matches are inserted into the list alphabetically.  Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :glob:

   intro*
   recipe/*
   *
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This includes first all documents whose names start with \fBintro\fP, then all
documents in the \fBrecipe\fP folder, then all remaining documents (except the
one containing the directive, of course.) [2]
.sp
The special entry name \fBself\fP stands for the document containing the
toctree directive.  This is useful if you want to generate a \(dqsitemap\(dq from
the toctree.
.sp
You can use the \fBreversed\fP flag option to reverse the order of the entries
in the list. This can be useful when using the \fBglob\fP flag option to
reverse the ordering of the files.  Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :reversed:

   recipe/*
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also give a \(dqhidden\(dq option to the directive, like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   doc_1
   doc_2
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will still notify Sphinx of the document hierarchy, but not insert links
into the document at the location of the directive \-\- this makes sense if you
intend to insert these links yourself, in a different style, or in the HTML
sidebar.
.sp
In cases where you want to have only one top\-level toctree and hide all other
lower level toctrees you can add the \(dqincludehidden\(dq option to the top\-level
toctree entry:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. toctree::
   :includehidden:

   doc_1
   doc_2
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

In the end, all documents in the \fI\%source directory\fP (or subdirectories)
must occur in some \fBtoctree\fP directive; Sphinx will emit a warning if it
finds a file that is not included, because that means that this file will not
be reachable through standard navigation.

Use \fI\%exclude_patterns\fP to explicitly exclude documents or
directories from building completely.  Use \fI\%the \(dqorphan\(dq metadata\fP to let a document be built, but notify Sphinx that it is not
reachable via a toctree.

The \(dqroot document\(dq (selected by \fI\%root_doc\fP) is the \(dqroot\(dq of the TOC
tree hierarchy.  It can be used as the documentation\(aqs main page, or as a

Sphinx reserves some document names for its own use; you should not try to
create documents with these names \-\- it will cause problems.

The special document names (and pages generated for them) are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBgenindex\fP, \fBmodindex\fP, \fBsearch\fP
.sp
These are used for the general index, the Python module index, and the search
page, respectively.
.sp
The general index is populated with entries from modules, all
index\-generating \fI\%object descriptions\fP, and from
\fI\%index\fP directives.
.sp
The Python module index contains one entry per \fI\%py:module\fP
directive.
.sp
The search page contains a form that uses the generated JSON search index and
JavaScript to full\-text search the generated documents for search words; it
should work on every major browser that supports modern JavaScript.
.IP \(bu 2
every name beginning with \fB_\fP
.sp
Though few such names are currently used by Sphinx, you should not
create documents or document\-containing directories with such names.  (Using
\fB_\fP as a prefix for a custom template directory is fine.)

.SS Showing code examples
.sp
There are multiple ways to show syntax\-highlighted literal code blocks in
Sphinx:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
using \fI\%reST doctest blocks\fP;
.IP \(bu 2
using \fI\%reST literal blocks\fP, optionally in
combination with the \fI\%highlight\fP directive;
.IP \(bu 2
using the \fI\%code\-block\fP directive;
.IP \(bu 2
and using the \fI\%literalinclude\fP directive.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Doctest blocks can only be used
to show interactive Python sessions, while the remaining three can be used for
other languages. Of these three, literal blocks are useful when an entire
document, or at least large sections of it, use code blocks with the same
syntax and which should be styled in the same manner. On the other hand, the
\fI\%code\-block\fP directive makes more sense when you want more fine\-tuned
control over the styling of each block or when you have a document containing
code blocks using multiple varied syntaxes. Finally, the
\fI\%literalinclude\fP directive is useful for including entire code files
in your documentation.
.sp
In all cases, Syntax highlighting is provided by \X'tty: link https://pygments.org'\fI\%Pygments\fP\X'tty: link'\&. When using literal blocks, this is configured using
any \fI\%highlight\fP directives in the source file. When a \fBhighlight\fP
directive is encountered, it is used until the next \fBhighlight\fP directive is
encountered. If there is no \fBhighlight\fP directive in the file, the global
highlighting language is used. This defaults to \fBpython\fP but can be
configured using the \fI\%highlight_language\fP config value. The following
values are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP (no highlighting)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdefault\fP (similar to \fBpython3\fP but with a fallback to \fBnone\fP without

.B \&.. literalinclude:: filename
Longer displays of verbatim text may be included by storing the example text

Python source file \fBexample.py\fP, use:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. literalinclude:: example.py
.EE

The file name is usually relative to the current file\(aqs path.  However, if
it is absolute (starting with \fB/\fP), it is relative to the top source
directory.
.sp
\fBAdditional options\fP
.sp
Like \fI\%code\-block\fP, the directive supports the \fBlinenos\fP flag
option to switch on line numbers, the \fBlineno\-start\fP option to select the
first line number, the \fBemphasize\-lines\fP option to emphasize particular
lines, the \fBname\fP option to provide an implicit target name, the
\fBdedent\fP option to strip indentation characters for the code block, and a
\fBlanguage\fP option to select a language different from the current file\(aqs
standard language. In addition, it supports the \fBcaption\fP option; however,
this can be provided with no argument to use the filename as the caption.
Example with options:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. literalinclude:: example.rb
   :language: ruby
   :emphasize\-lines: 12,15\-18
   :linenos:
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Tabs in the input are expanded if you give a \fBtab\-width\fP option with the
desired tab width.
.sp
Include files are assumed to be encoded in the \fI\%source_encoding\fP\&.
If the file has a different encoding, you can specify it with the
\fBencoding\fP option:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :encoding: latin\-1
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The directive also supports including only parts of the file.  If it is a
Python module, you can select a class, function or method to include using
the \fBpyobject\fP option:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :pyobject: Timer.start
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would only include the code lines belonging to the \fBstart()\fP method
in the \fBTimer\fP class within the file.
.sp
Alternately, you can specify exactly which lines to include by giving a
\fBlines\fP option:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :lines: 1,3,5\-10,20\-
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This includes the lines 1, 3, 5 to 10 and lines 20 to the last line.
.sp
Another way to control which part of the file is included is to use the
\fBstart\-after\fP and \fBend\-before\fP options (or only one of them).  If
\fBstart\-after\fP is given as a string option, only lines that follow the
first line containing that string are included.  If \fBend\-before\fP is given
as a string option, only lines that precede the first lines containing that
string are included. The \fBstart\-at\fP and \fBend\-at\fP options behave in a
similar way, but the lines containing the matched string are included.
.sp
\fBstart\-after\fP/\fBstart\-at\fP and \fBend\-before\fP/\fBend\-at\fP can have same string.
\fBstart\-after\fP/\fBstart\-at\fP filter lines before the line that contains
option string (\fBstart\-at\fP will keep the line). Then \fBend\-before\fP/\fBend\-at\fP
filter lines after the line that contains option string (\fBend\-at\fP will keep
the line and \fBend\-before\fP skip the first line).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you want to select only \fB[second\-section]\fP of ini file like the

When lines have been selected in any of the ways described above, the line
numbers in \fBemphasize\-lines\fP refer to those selected lines, counted
consecutively starting at \fB1\fP\&.
.sp
When specifying particular parts of a file to display, it can be useful to
display the original line numbers. This can be done using the
\fBlineno\-match\fP option, which is however allowed only when the selection
consists of contiguous lines.
.sp
You can prepend and/or append a line to the included code, using the
\fBprepend\fP and \fBappend\fP option, respectively.  This is useful e.g. for
highlighting PHP code that doesn\(aqt include the \fB<?php\fP/\fB?>\fP markers.
.sp
If you want to show the diff of the code, you can specify the old file by
giving a \fBdiff\fP option:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :diff: example.py.orig
.EE
.UNINDENT

Note that \(dqkey\(dq is used for grouping key as is.
The \(dqkey\(dq isn\(aqt normalized; key \(dqA\(dq and \(dqa\(dq become different groups.
The whole characters in \(dqkey\(dq is used instead of a first character; it is
used for \(dqCombining Character Sequence\(dq and \(dqSurrogate Pairs\(dq grouping key.

In i18n situation, you can specify \(dqlocalized term : key\(dq even if original
text only have \(dqterm\(dq part. In this case, translated \(dqlocalized term\(dq will be

.SS Meta\-information markup
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. sectionauthor:: name <email>
Identifies the author of the current section.  The argument should include
the author\(aqs name such that it can be used for presentation and email
address.  The domain name portion of the address should be lower case.
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, this markup isn\(aqt reflected in the output in any way (it helps

\fI\%show_authors\fP to \fBTrue\fP to make them produce a paragraph in the
output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. codeauthor:: name <email>
The \fI\%codeauthor\fP directive, which can appear multiple times, names
the authors of the described code, just like \fI\%sectionauthor\fP names
the author(s) of a piece of documentation.  It too only produces output if
the \fI\%show_authors\fP configuration value is \fBTrue\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Index\-generating markup
.sp
Sphinx automatically creates index entries from all object descriptions (like
functions, classes or attributes) like discussed in
\fI\%Domains\fP\&.
.sp
However, there is also explicit markup available, to make the index more
comprehensive and enable index entries in documents where information is not
mainly contained in information units, such as the language reference.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. index:: <entries>
This directive contains one or more index entries.  Each entry consists of a
type and a value, separated by a colon.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index::
   single: execution; context
   pair: module; __main__
   pair: module; sys
   triple: module; search; path
   seealso: scope

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This directive contains five entries, which will be converted to entries in
the generated index which link to the exact location of the index statement
(or, in case of offline media, the corresponding page number).
.sp
Since index directives generate cross\-reference targets at their location in
the source, it makes sense to put them \fIbefore\fP the thing they refer to \-\-
e.g. a heading, as in the example above.
.sp
The possible entry types are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B single
Creates a single index entry.
Can be made a sub\-entry by separating the sub\-entry text with a semicolon
(this notation is also used below to describe what entries are created).
Examples:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index:: single: execution
           single: execution; context
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsingle: execution\fP creates an index entry labelled \fBexecution\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsingle: execution; context\fP creates an sub\-entry of \fBexecution\fP
labelled \fBcontext\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B pair
A shortcut to create two index entries.
The pair of values must be separated by a semicolon.
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index:: pair: loop; statement
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would create two index entries; \fBloop; statement\fP and \fBstatement; loop\fP\&.
.TP
.B triple
A shortcut to create three index entries.
All three values must be separated by a semicolon.
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index:: triple: module; search; path
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would create three index entries; \fBmodule; search path\fP,
\fBsearch; path, module\fP, and \fBpath; module search\fP\&.
.TP
.B see
A shortcut to create an index entry that refers to another entry.
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index:: see: entry; other
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would create an index entry referring from \fBentry\fP to \fBother\fP
(i.e. \(aqentry\(aq: See \(aqother\(aq).
.TP
.B seealso
Like \fBsee\fP, but inserts \(aqsee also\(aq instead of \(aqsee\(aq.
.TP
.B module, keyword, operator, object, exception, statement, builtin
These \fBdeprecated\fP shortcuts all create two index entries.
For example, \fBmodule: hashlib\fP creates the entries \fBmodule; hashlib\fP
and \fBhashlib; module\fP\&.
.sp
Deprecated since version 1.0: These Python\-specific entry types are deprecated.

.sp
Changed in version 7.1: Removal version set to Sphinx 9.0.
Using these entry types will now emit warnings with the \fBindex\fP category.

.UNINDENT
.sp
You can mark up \(dqmain\(dq index entries by prefixing them with an exclamation
mark.  The references to \(dqmain\(dq entries are emphasized in the generated
index.  For example, if two pages contain
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index:: Python
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and one page contains
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index:: ! Python
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
then the backlink to the latter page is emphasized among the three backlinks.
.sp
For index directives containing only \(dqsingle\(dq entries, there is a shorthand
notation:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index:: BNF, grammar, syntax, notation
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This creates four index entries.

.TP
.B :index:
While the \fI\%index\fP directive is a block\-level markup and links to the
beginning of the next paragraph, there is also a corresponding role that sets
the link target directly where it is used.
.sp
The content of the role can be a simple phrase, which is then kept in the
text and used as an index entry.  It can also be a combination of text and
index entry, styled like with explicit targets of cross\-references.  In that
case, the \(dqtarget\(dq part can be a full entry as described for the directive
above.  For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
This is a normal reST :index:\(gaparagraph\(ga that contains several
:index:\(gaindex entries <pair: index; entry>\(ga.

.SS Including content based on tags
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. only:: <expression>
Include the content of the directive only if the \fIexpression\fP is true.  The

.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. only:: html and draft
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Undefined tags are false, defined tags (via the \fB\-t\fP command\-line option or
within \fBconf.py\fP, see \fI\%here\fP) are true.  Boolean
expressions, also using parentheses (like \fB(latex or html) and draft\fP) are
supported.
.sp
The \fIformat\fP and the \fIname\fP of the current builder (\fBhtml\fP, \fBlatex\fP or
\fBtext\fP) are always set as a tag [4]\&.  To make the distinction between
format and name explicit, they are also added with the prefix \fBformat_\fP and
\fBbuilder_\fP, e.g. the epub builder defines the tags  \fBhtml\fP, \fBepub\fP,
\fBformat_html\fP and \fBbuilder_epub\fP\&.
.sp
These standard tags are set \fIafter\fP the configuration file is read, so they
are not available there.
.sp
All tags must follow the standard Python identifier syntax as set out in
the \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers'\fI\%Identifiers and keywords\fP\X'tty: link'
documentation.  That is, a tag expression may only consist of tags that
conform to the syntax of Python variables.  In ASCII, this consists of the
uppercase and lowercase letters \fBA\fP through \fBZ\fP, the underscore \fB_\fP
and, except for the first character, the digits \fB0\fP through \fB9\fP\&.

.B \&.. tabularcolumns:: column spec
This directive influences only the LaTeX output for the next table in

.B \&.. math::

   (a \- b)^2 = a^2 \- 2ab + b^2
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, each single equation is set within a \fBsplit\fP environment,

.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

Normally, equations are not numbered.  If you want your equation to get a
number, use the \fBlabel\fP option.  When given, it selects an internal label
for the equation, by which it can be cross\-referenced, and causes an equation
number to be issued.  See \fI\%eq\fP for an example.  The numbering
style depends on the output format.
.sp
There is also an option \fBnowrap\fP that prevents any wrapping of the given
math in a math environment.  When you give this option, you must make sure
yourself that the math is properly set up.  For example:

.SS Grammar production displays
.sp
Special markup is available for displaying the productions of a formal grammar.
The markup is simple and does not attempt to model all aspects of BNF (or any
derived forms), but provides enough to allow context\-free grammars to be
displayed in a way that causes uses of a symbol to be rendered as hyperlinks to
the definition of the symbol.  There is this directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. productionlist:: [productionGroup]
This directive is used to enclose a group of productions.  Each production
is given on a single line and consists of a name, separated by a colon from
the following definition.  If the definition spans multiple lines, each
continuation line must begin with a colon placed at the same column as in
the first line.
Blank lines are not allowed within \fBproductionlist\fP directive arguments.
.sp
The definition can contain token names which are marked as interpreted text
(e.g., \(dq\fBsum ::= \(gainteger\(ga \(dq+\(dq \(gainteger\(ga\fP\(dq) \-\- this generates
cross\-references to the productions of these tokens.  Outside of the
production list, you can reference to token productions using
\fI\%token\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIproductionGroup\fP argument to \fI\%productionlist\fP serves to
distinguish different sets of production lists that belong to different
grammars.  Multiple production lists with the same \fIproductionGroup\fP thus
define rules in the same scope.
.sp
Inside of the production list, tokens implicitly refer to productions
from the current group. You can refer to the production of another
grammar by prefixing the token with its group name and a colon, e.g,
\(dq\fBotherGroup:sum\fP\(dq. If the group of the token should not be shown in
the production, it can be prefixed by a tilde, e.g.,
\(dq\fB~otherGroup:sum\fP\(dq. To refer to a production from an unnamed
grammar, the token should be prefixed by a colon, e.g., \(dq\fB:sum\fP\(dq.
.sp
Outside of the production list,
if you have given a \fIproductionGroup\fP argument you must prefix the
token name in the cross\-reference with the group name and a colon,
e.g., \(dq\fBmyGroup:sum\fP\(dq instead of just \(dq\fBsum\fP\(dq.
If the group should not be shown in the title of the link either
an explicit title can be given (e.g., \(dq\fBmyTitle <myGroup:sum>\fP\(dq),
or the target can be prefixed with a tilde (e.g., \(dq\fB~myGroup:sum\fP\(dq).
.sp
Note that no further reST parsing is done in the production, so that you
don\(aqt have to escape \fB*\fP or \fB|\fP characters.

.SS Markdown
.sp
\X'tty: link https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'\fI\%Markdown\fP\X'tty: link' is a lightweight markup language with a simplistic plain text
formatting syntax.  It exists in many syntactically different \fIflavors\fP\&.  To
support Markdown\-based documentation, Sphinx can use \X'tty: link https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'\fI\%MyST\-Parser\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
MyST\-Parser is a Docutils bridge to \X'tty: link https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py'\fI\%markdown\-it\-py\fP\X'tty: link', a Python package for
parsing the \X'tty: link https://commonmark.org/'\fI\%CommonMark\fP\X'tty: link' Markdown flavor.
.SS Configuration
.sp
To configure your Sphinx project for Markdown support, proceed as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Install the Markdown parser \fIMyST\-Parser\fP:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
pip install \-\-upgrade myst\-parser
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP 2. 3
Add \fImyst_parser\fP to the
\fI\%list of configured extensions\fP:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
extensions = [\(aqmyst_parser\(aq]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
MyST\-Parser requires Sphinx 2.1 or newer.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP 3. 3
If you want to use Markdown files with extensions other than \fB\&.md\fP, adjust
the \fI\%source_suffix\fP variable.  The following example configures
Sphinx to parse all files with the extensions \fB\&.md\fP and \fB\&.txt\fP as
Markdown:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
source_suffix = {
    \(aq.rst\(aq: \(aqrestructuredtext\(aq,
    \(aq.txt\(aq: \(aqmarkdown\(aq,
    \(aq.md\(aq: \(aqmarkdown\(aq,
}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP 4. 3
You can further configure \fIMyST\-Parser\fP to allow custom syntax that
standard \fICommonMark\fP doesn\(aqt support.  Read more in the \X'tty: link https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax-optional.html'\fI\%MyST\-Parser
documentation\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing syntax
.sp
Cross\-references are generated by many semantic interpreted text roles.
Basically, you only need to write \fB:role:\(gatarget\(ga\fP, and a link will be
created to the item named \fItarget\fP of the type indicated by \fIrole\fP\&.  The link\(aqs
text will be the same as \fItarget\fP\&.
.sp
There are some additional facilities, however, that make cross\-referencing
roles more versatile:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You may supply an explicit title and reference target, like in reST direct
hyperlinks: \fB:role:\(gatitle <target>\(ga\fP will refer to \fItarget\fP, but the link
text will be \fItitle\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
If you prefix the content with \fB!\fP, no reference/hyperlink will be created.
.IP \(bu 2
If you prefix the content with \fB~\fP, the link text will only be the last
component of the target.  For example, \fB:py:meth:\(ga~Queue.Queue.get\(ga\fP will
refer to \fBQueue.Queue.get\fP but only display \fBget\fP as the link text.  This
does not work with all cross\-reference roles, but is domain specific.
.sp
In HTML output, the link\(aqs \fBtitle\fP attribute (that is e.g. shown as a
tool\-tip on mouse\-hover) will always be the full target name.
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing anything
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :any:
Added in version 1.3.

.sp
This convenience role tries to do its best to find a valid target for its
reference text.
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
First, it tries standard cross\-reference targets that would be referenced
by \fI\%doc\fP, \fI\%ref\fP or \fI\%option\fP\&.
.sp
Custom objects added to the standard domain by extensions (see
\fI\%Sphinx.add_object_type()\fP) are also searched.
.IP \(bu 2
Then, it looks for objects (targets) in all loaded domains.  It is up to
the domains how specific a match must be.  For example, in the Python
domain a reference of \fB:any:\(gaBuilder\(ga\fP would match the
\fBsphinx.builders.Builder\fP class.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If none or multiple targets are found, a warning will be emitted.  In the
case of multiple targets, you can change \(dqany\(dq to a specific role.
.sp
This role is a good candidate for setting \fI\%default_role\fP\&.  If you
do, you can write cross\-references without a lot of markup overhead.  For
example, in this Python function documentation:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. function:: install()

   This function installs a \(gahandler\(ga for every signal known by the
   \(gasignal\(ga module.  See the section \(gaabout\-signals\(ga for more information.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
there could be references to a glossary term (usually \fB:term:\(gahandler\(ga\fP), a
Python module (usually \fB:py:mod:\(gasignal\(ga\fP or \fB:mod:\(gasignal\(ga\fP) and a
section (usually \fB:ref:\(gaabout\-signals\(ga\fP).
.sp
The \fI\%any\fP role also works together with the
\fI\%intersphinx\fP extension: when no local cross\-reference is
found, all object types of intersphinx inventories are also searched.
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing objects
.sp
These roles are described with their respective domains:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Python\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%C\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%C++\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%JavaScript\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%ReST\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing arbitrary locations
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :ref:
To support cross\-referencing to arbitrary locations in any document, the
standard reST labels are used.  For this to work label names must be unique
throughout the entire documentation.  There are two ways in which you can
refer to labels:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you place a label directly before a section title, you can reference to
it with \fB:ref:\(galabel\-name\(ga\fP\&.  For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. _my\-reference\-label:

Section to cross\-reference
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

This is the text of the section.

It refers to the section itself, see :ref:\(gamy\-reference\-label\(ga.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB:ref:\fP role would then generate a link to the section, with the
link title being \(dqSection to cross\-reference\(dq.  This works just as well
when section and reference are in different source files.
.sp
Automatic labels also work with figures. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. _my\-figure:

\&.. figure:: whatever

   Figure caption
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, a  reference \fB:ref:\(gamy\-figure\(ga\fP would insert a reference
to the figure with link text \(dqFigure caption\(dq.
.sp
The same works for tables that are given an explicit caption using the
\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table'\fI\%table\fP\X'tty: link' directive.
.IP \(bu 2
Labels that aren\(aqt placed before a section title can still be referenced,
but you must give the link an explicit title, using this syntax:
\fB:ref:\(gaLink title <label\-name>\(ga\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Reference labels must start with an underscore. When referencing a label,
the underscore must be omitted (see examples above).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using \fI\%ref\fP is advised over standard reStructuredText links to
sections (like \fB\(gaSection title\(ga_\fP) because it works across files, when
section headings are changed, will raise warnings if incorrect, and works
for all builders that support cross\-references.
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing documents
.sp
Added in version 0.6.

.sp
There is also a way to directly link to documents:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :doc:
Link to the specified document; the document name can be specified in
absolute or relative fashion.  For example, if the reference
\fB:doc:\(gaparrot\(ga\fP occurs in the document \fBsketches/index\fP, then the link
refers to \fBsketches/parrot\fP\&.  If the reference is \fB:doc:\(ga/people\(ga\fP or
\fB:doc:\(ga../people\(ga\fP, the link refers to \fBpeople\fP\&.
.sp
If no explicit link text is given (like usual: \fB:doc:\(gaMonty Python members
</people>\(ga\fP), the link caption will be the title of the given document.
.UNINDENT
.SS Referencing downloadable files
.sp
Added in version 0.6.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :download:
This role lets you link to files within your source tree that are not reST
documents that can be viewed, but files that can be downloaded.
.sp
When you use this role, the referenced file is automatically marked for
inclusion in the output when building (obviously, for HTML output only).
All downloadable files are put into a \fB_downloads/<unique hash>/\fP
subdirectory of the output directory; duplicate filenames are handled.
.sp
An example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
See :download:\(gathis example script <../example.py>\(ga.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The given filename is usually relative to the directory the current source
file is contained in, but if it absolute (starting with \fB/\fP), it is taken
as relative to the top source directory.
.sp
The \fBexample.py\fP file will be copied to the output directory, and a
suitable link generated to it.
.sp
Not to show unavailable download links, you should wrap whole paragraphs that
have this role:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. only:: builder_html

   See :download:\(gathis example script <../example.py>\(ga.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing figures by figure number
.sp
Added in version 1.3.

.sp
Changed in version 1.5: \fI\%numref\fP role can also refer sections.
And \fI\%numref\fP allows \fB{name}\fP for the link text.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :numref:
Link to the specified figures, tables, code\-blocks and sections; the standard
reST labels are used.  When you use this role, it will insert a reference to
the figure with link text by its figure number like \(dqFig. 1.1\(dq.
.sp
If an explicit link text is given (as usual: \fB:numref:\(gaImage of Sphinx (Fig.
%s) <my\-figure>\(ga\fP), the link caption will serve as title of the reference.
As placeholders, \fI%s\fP and \fI{number}\fP get replaced by the figure
number and  \fI{name}\fP by the figure caption.
If no explicit link text is given, the \fI\%numfig_format\fP setting is
used as fall\-back default.
.sp
If \fI\%numfig\fP is \fBFalse\fP, figures are not numbered,
so this role inserts not a reference but the label or the link text.
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing other items of interest
.sp
The following roles do possibly create a cross\-reference, but do not refer to
objects:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :envvar:
An environment variable.  Index entries are generated.  Also generates a link
to the matching \fI\%envvar\fP directive, if it exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :token:
The name of a grammar token (used to create links between
\fI\%productionlist\fP directives).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :keyword:
The name of a keyword in Python.  This creates a link to a reference label
with that name, if it exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :option:
A command\-line option to an executable program.  This generates a link to
a \fI\%option\fP directive, if it exists.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following role creates a cross\-reference to a term in a
\fI\%glossary\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :term:
Reference to a term in a glossary.  A glossary is created using the
\fBglossary\fP directive containing a definition list with terms and
definitions.  It does not have to be in the same file as the \fBterm\fP markup,
for example the Python docs have one global glossary in the \fBglossary.rst\fP
file.
.sp
If you use a term that\(aqs not explained in a glossary, you\(aqll get a warning
during build.
.UNINDENT
.SS Configuration
.sp
The \fI\%configuration directory\fP must contain a file named \fBconf.py\fP\&.
This file (containing Python code) is called the \(dqbuild configuration file\(dq
and contains (almost) all configuration needed to customize Sphinx input
and output behavior.
.sp
An optional file \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/config.html'\fI\%docutils.conf\fP\X'tty: link' can be added to the configuration
directory to adjust \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/'\fI\%Docutils\fP\X'tty: link' configuration if not otherwise overridden or
set by Sphinx.
.sp
The configuration file is executed as Python code at build time (using
\X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module'\fI\%importlib.import_module()\fP\X'tty: link', and with the current directory set to its
containing directory), and therefore can execute arbitrarily complex code.
Sphinx then reads simple names from the file\(aqs namespace as its configuration.
.sp
Important points to note:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If not otherwise documented, values must be strings, and their default is the
empty string.
.IP \(bu 2
The term \(dqfully\-qualified name\(dq refers to a string that names an importable
Python object inside a module; for example, the FQN
\fB\(dqsphinx.builders.Builder\(dq\fP means the \fBBuilder\fP class in the
\fBsphinx.builders\fP module.
.IP \(bu 2
Remember that document names use \fB/\fP as the path separator and don\(aqt
contain the file name extension.
.IP \(bu 2
Since \fBconf.py\fP is read as a Python file, the usual rules apply for
encodings and Unicode support.
.IP \(bu 2
The contents of the config namespace are pickled (so that Sphinx can find out
when configuration changes), so it may not contain unpickleable values \-\-
delete them from the namespace with \fBdel\fP if appropriate.  Modules are
removed automatically, so you don\(aqt need to \fBdel\fP your imports after use.
.IP \(bu 2
There is a special object named \fBtags\fP available in the config file.
It can be used to query and change the tags (see \fI\%Including content based on tags\fP).  Use
\fB\(aqtag\(aq in tags\fP to query, \fBtags.add(\(aqtag\(aq)\fP and \fBtags.remove(\(aqtag\(aq)\fP
to change. Only tags set via the \fB\-t\fP command\-line option or via
\fBtags.add(\(aqtag\(aq)\fP can be queried using \fB\(aqtag\(aq in tags\fP\&.
Note that the current builder tag is not available in \fBconf.py\fP, as it is
created \fIafter\fP the builder is initialized.

.B extensions
A list of strings that are module names of \fI\%extensions\fP\&. These can be extensions coming with Sphinx (named
\fBsphinx.ext.*\fP) or custom ones.
.sp
Note that you can extend \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path'\fI\%sys.path\fP\X'tty: link' within the conf file if your
extensions live in another directory \-\- but make sure you use absolute paths.
If your extension path is relative to the \fI\%configuration directory\fP,
use \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.abspath'\fI\%os.path.abspath()\fP\X'tty: link' like so:
.INDENT 7.0

.EX
import sys, os

sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(\(aqsphinxext\(aq))

extensions = [\(aqextname\(aq]

.B source_suffix
The file extensions of source files.  Sphinx considers the files with this

If your project uses Unicode characters, setting the engine to

\fB\(aqpdflatex\(aq\fP work with the extra Unicode characters.  Since Sphinx 2.0
the default is the GNU FreeFont which covers well Latin, Cyrillic and

Author for the LaTeX document.  The same LaTeX markup caveat as for \fItitle\fP

.B class sphinx.builders.latex.LaTeXBuilder
This builder produces LaTeX source files in the output directory.  The
actual PDF builds happen inside this output directory and need to be
triggered in a second step.  This can be done via
\fBmake all\-pdf\fP there.
To combine the two steps into only one, use \fI\%sphinx\-build \-M\fP
(i.e. \fB\-M latexpdf\fP not \fB\-b latexpdf\fP) or \fBmake latexpdf\fP
at the project root.
.sp
See \fI\%latex_documents\fP and the chapter \fI\%Options for LaTeX output\fP for
available options.

PDF builds need a sufficiently complete LaTeX installation.
The testing is currently (since 5.3.0) done on Ubuntu 22.04LTS,
whose LaTeX distribution matches upstream TeXLive 2021 as of 2022/02/04,

.SS Domains
.sp
Added in version 1.0.

.sp
Originally, Sphinx was conceived for a single project, the documentation of the
Python language.  Shortly afterwards, it was made available for everyone as a
documentation tool, but the documentation of Python modules remained deeply
built in \-\- the most fundamental directives, like \fBfunction\fP, were designed
for Python objects.  Since Sphinx has become somewhat popular, interest
developed in using it for many different purposes: C/C++ projects, JavaScript,
or even reStructuredText markup (like in this documentation).
.sp
While this was always possible, it is now much easier to easily support
documentation of projects using different programming languages or even ones
not supported by the main Sphinx distribution, by providing a \fBdomain\fP for
every such purpose.
.sp
A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText \fI\%directive\fPs and
\fI\%role\fPs) to describe and link to \fI\%object\fPs belonging together,
e.g. elements of a programming language.  Directive and role names in a domain
have names like \fBdomain:name\fP, e.g. \fBpy:function\fP\&.  Domains can also
provide custom indices (like the Python Module Index).
.sp
Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of
documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also means
that extensions that support the documentation of whole new languages are much
easier to write.
.sp
This section describes what the domains that are included with Sphinx provide.
The domain API is documented as well, in the section \fI\%Domain API\fP\&.
.SS Basic Markup
.sp
Most domains provide a number of \fIobject description directives\fP, used to
describe specific objects provided by modules.  Each directive requires one or
more signatures to provide basic information about what is being described, and
the content should be the description.
.sp
A domain will typically keep an internal index of all entities to aid
cross\-referencing.
Typically it will also add entries in the shown general index.
If you want to suppress the addition of an entry in the shown index, you can
give the directive option flag \fB:no\-index\-entry:\fP\&.
If you want to exclude the object description from the table of contents, you
can give the directive option flag \fB:no\-contents\-entry:\fP\&.
If you want to typeset an object description, without even making it available
for cross\-referencing, you can give the directive option flag \fB:no\-index:\fP
(which implies \fB:no\-index\-entry:\fP).
If you do not want to typeset anything, you can give the directive option flag
\fB:no\-typesetting:\fP\&.  This can for example be used to create only a target and
index entry for later reference.
Though, note that not every directive in every domain may support these
options.
.sp
Added in version 3.2: The directive option \fBnoindexentry\fP in the Python, C, C++, and Javascript
domains.

.sp
Added in version 5.2.3: The directive option \fB:nocontentsentry:\fP in the Python, C, C++, Javascript,
and reStructuredText domains.

.sp
Added in version 7.2: The directive option \fBno\-typesetting\fP in the Python, C, C++, Javascript,
and reStructuredText domains.

.sp
Changed in version 7.2: 
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The directive option \fB:noindex:\fP was renamed
to \fB:no\-index:\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The directive option \fB:noindexentry:\fP was renamed
to \fB:no\-index\-entry:\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The directive option \fB:nocontentsentry:\fP was renamed
to \fB:no\-contents\-entry:\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The previous names are retained as aliases,
but will be deprecated and removed
in a future version of Sphinx.

.sp
An example using a Python domain directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. py:function:: spam(eggs)
                 ham(eggs)

   Spam or ham the foo.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This describes the two Python functions \fBspam\fP and \fBham\fP\&.  (Note that when
signatures become too long, you can break them if you add a backslash to lines
that are continued in the next line.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. py:function:: filterwarnings(action, message=\(aq\(aq, category=Warning, \e
                                module=\(aq\(aq, lineno=0, append=False)
   :no\-index:
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(This example also shows how to use the \fB:no\-index:\fP flag.)
.sp
The domains also provide roles that link back to these object descriptions.
For example, to link to one of the functions described in the example above,
you could say
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
The function :py:func:\(gaspam\(ga does a similar thing.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As you can see, both directive and role names contain the domain name and the
directive name.
.sp
The directive option \fB:no\-typesetting:\fP can be used to create a target
(and index entry) which can later be referenced
by the roles provided by the domain.
This is particularly useful for literate programming:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. py:function:: spam(eggs)
   :no\-typesetting:

\&.. code::

   def spam(eggs):
       pass

The function :py:func:\(gaspam\(ga does nothing.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Default Domain
.sp
For documentation describing objects from solely one domain, authors will not
have to state again its name at each directive, role, etc... after
having specified a default. This can be done either via the config
value \fI\%primary_domain\fP or via this directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. default\-domain:: name
Select a new default domain.  While the \fI\%primary_domain\fP selects a
global default, this only has an effect within the same file.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If no other default is selected, the Python domain (named \fBpy\fP) is the
default one, mostly for compatibility with documentation written for older
versions of Sphinx.
.sp
Directives and roles that belong to the default domain can be mentioned without
giving the domain name, i.e.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. function:: pyfunc()

   Describes a Python function.

Reference to :func:\(gapyfunc\(ga.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Cross\-referencing syntax
.sp
For cross\-reference roles provided by domains, the same facilities exist as for
general cross\-references.  See \fI\%Cross\-referencing syntax\fP\&.
.sp
In short:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You may supply an explicit title and reference target: \fB:role:\(gatitle
<target>\(ga\fP will refer to \fItarget\fP, but the link text will be \fItitle\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
If you prefix the content with \fB!\fP, no reference/hyperlink will be created.
.IP \(bu 2
If you prefix the content with \fB~\fP, the link text will only be the last
component of the target.  For example, \fB:py:meth:\(ga~Queue.Queue.get\(ga\fP will
refer to \fBQueue.Queue.get\fP but only display \fBget\fP as the link text.
.UNINDENT
.SS Built\-in domains
.sp
The following domains are included within Sphinx:
.SS The Standard Domain
.sp
Added in version 1.0.

.sp
The so\-called \(dqstandard\(dq domain collects all markup that doesn\(aqt warrant a
domain of its own.  Its directives and roles are not prefixed with a domain
name.
.sp
The standard domain is also where custom object descriptions, added using the
\fI\%add_object_type()\fP API, are placed.
.sp
There is a set of directives allowing documenting command\-line programs:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. option:: name args, name args, ...
Describes a command line argument or switch.  Option argument names should
be enclosed in angle brackets.  Examples:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. option:: dest_dir

   Destination directory.

\&.. option:: \-m <module>, \-\-module <module>

   Run a module as a script.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The directive will create cross\-reference targets for the given options,
referenceable by \fI\%option\fP (in the example case, you\(aqd use something
like \fB:option:\(gadest_dir\(ga\fP, \fB:option:\(ga\-m\(ga\fP, or \fB:option:\(ga\-\-module\(ga\fP).
.sp
Changed in version 5.3: One can cross\-reference including an option value: \fB:option:\(ga\-\-module=foobar\(ga\fP,
,\(ga\(ga:option:\fI\-\-module[=foobar]\(ga\(ga\fP or \fB:option:\(ga\-\-module foobar\(ga\fP\&.

.sp
Use \fI\%option_emphasise_placeholders\fP for parsing of
\(dqvariable part\(dq of a literal text (similarly to the \fI\%samp\fP role).
.sp
\fBcmdoption\fP directive is a deprecated alias for the \fBoption\fP directive.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. envvar:: name
Describes an environment variable that the documented code or program uses
or defines.  Referenceable by \fI\%envvar\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. program:: name
Like \fI\%py:currentmodule\fP, this directive produces no output.
Instead, it serves to notify Sphinx that all following \fI\%option\fP
directives document options for the program called \fIname\fP\&.
.sp
If you use \fI\%program\fP, you have to qualify the references in your
\fI\%option\fP roles by the program name, so if you have the following
situation
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. program:: rm

\&.. option:: \-r

   Work recursively.

\&.. program:: svn

\&.. option:: \-r <revision>

   Specify the revision to work upon.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
then \fB:option:\(garm \-r\(ga\fP would refer to the first option, while
\fB:option:\(gasvn \-r\(ga\fP would refer to the second one.
.sp
If \fBNone\fP is passed to the argument, the directive will reset the
current program name.
.sp
The program name may contain spaces (in case you want to document
subcommands like \fBsvn add\fP and \fBsvn commit\fP separately).
.sp
Added in version 0.5.

.UNINDENT
.sp
There is also a very generic object description directive, which is not tied to
any domain:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. describe:: text
.TP
.B \&.. object:: text
This directive produces the same formatting as the specific ones provided by
domains, but does not create index entries or cross\-referencing targets.
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. describe:: PAPER

   You can set this variable to select a paper size.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS The C Domain
.sp

C supports anonymous structs, enums, and unions.
For the sake of documentation they must be given some name that starts with

Added in version 3.1.

.sp
The C language it self does not support namespacing, but it can sometimes be
useful to emulate it in documentation, e.g., to show alternate declarations.
The feature may also be used to document members of structs/unions/enums
separate from their parent declaration.
.sp
The current scope can be changed using three namespace directives.  They manage
a stack declarations where \fBc:namespace\fP resets the stack and changes a given
scope.
.sp
The \fBc:namespace\-push\fP directive changes the scope to a given inner scope
of the current one.

.SS Namespacing
.sp
Declarations in the C++ domain are as default placed in global scope.  The
current scope can be changed using three namespace directives.  They manage a
stack declarations where \fBcpp:namespace\fP resets the stack and changes a given
scope.
.sp
The \fBcpp:namespace\-push\fP directive changes the scope to a given inner scope
of the current one.
.sp
The \fBcpp:namespace\-pop\fP directive undoes the most recent
\fBcpp:namespace\-push\fP directive.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. cpp:namespace:: scope specification
Changes the current scope for the subsequent objects to the given scope, and
resets the namespace directive stack.  Note that the namespace does not need
to correspond to C++ namespaces, but can end in names of classes, e.g.,:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. cpp:namespace:: Namespace1::Namespace2::SomeClass::AnInnerClass
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All subsequent objects will be defined as if their name were declared with
the scope prepended. The subsequent cross\-references will be searched for
starting in the current scope.
.sp
Using \fBNULL\fP, \fB0\fP, or \fBnullptr\fP as the scope will change to global
scope.
.sp
A namespace declaration can also be templated, e.g.,:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
the current scope will be \fBA::B\fP (\fInot\fP \fBA::B::C\fP).
.sp
If no previous \fBcpp:namespace\-push\fP directive has been used, but only a
\fBcpp:namespace\fP directive, then the current scope will be reset to global
scope.  That is, \fB\&.. cpp:namespace:: A::B\fP is equivalent to:

role.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Note on References with Templates Parameters/Arguments"
.sp
These roles follow the Sphinx \fI\%Cross\-referencing syntax\fP rules. This means care must
be taken when referencing a (partial) template specialization, e.g. if the
link looks like this: \fB:cpp:class:\(gaMyClass<int>\(ga\fP\&.
This is interpreted as a link to \fBint\fP with a title of \fBMyClass\fP\&.
In this case, escape the opening angle bracket with a backslash,
like this: \fB:cpp:class:\(gaMyClass\e<int>\(ga\fP\&.
.sp
When a custom title is not needed it may be useful to use the roles for
inline expressions, \fI\%cpp:expr\fP and \fI\%cpp:texpr\fP, where
angle brackets do not need escaping.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Declarations without template parameters and template arguments
.sp
For linking to non\-templated declarations the name must be a nested name, e.g.,
\fBf\fP or \fBMyClass::f\fP\&.
.SS Overloaded (member) functions
.sp
When a (member) function is referenced using just its name, the reference
will point to an arbitrary matching overload.
The \fI\%cpp:any\fP and \fI\%cpp:func\fP roles use an alternative
format, which simply is a complete function declaration.
This will resolve to the exact matching overload.
As example, consider the following class declaration:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B class C 
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B void f(double d) const 
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP

References using the \fI\%cpp:func\fP role:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Arbitrary overload: \fBC::f\fP, \fI\%C::f()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Also arbitrary overload: \fBC::f()\fP, \fI\%C::f()\fP

.IP \(bu 2
Specific overload: \fBvoid C::f(double)\fP, \fI\%void C::f(double)\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Specific overload: \fBvoid C::f(double) const\fP,
\fI\%void C::f(double) const\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the \fI\%add_function_parentheses\fP configuration variable
does not influence specific overload references.
.SS Templated declarations
.sp
Assume the following declarations.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B class Wrapper 
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B template<typename TOuter> class Outer 
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B template<typename TInner> class Inner 
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In general the reference must include the template parameter declarations,
and template arguments for the prefix of qualified names. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtemplate\e<typename TOuter> Wrapper::Outer\fP
(\fI\%template<typename TOuter> Wrapper::Outer\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtemplate\e<typename TOuter> template\e<typename TInner> Wrapper::Outer<TOuter>::Inner\fP
(\fBtemplate<typename TOuter> template<typename TInner> Wrapper::Outer<TOuter>::Inner\fP)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Currently the lookup only succeed if the template parameter identifiers are
equal strings.  That is, \fBtemplate\e<typename UOuter> Wrapper::Outer\fP will not
work.
.sp
As a shorthand notation, if a template parameter list is omitted,
then the lookup will assume either a primary template or a non\-template,
but not a partial template specialisation.
This means the following references work as well:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBWrapper::Outer\fP
(\fI\%Wrapper::Outer\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBWrapper::Outer::Inner\fP
(\fI\%Wrapper::Outer::Inner\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtemplate\e<typename TInner> Wrapper::Outer::Inner\fP

.UNINDENT
.SS (Full) Template Specialisations

.B template<typename TInner> class Inner 
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B template<> class Inner<bool> 
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In general the reference must include a template parameter list for each
template argument list.  The full specialisation above can therefore be
referenced with \fBtemplate\e<> Outer\e<int>\fP (\fI\%template<>
Outer<int>\fP) and \fBtemplate\e<> template\e<> Outer\e<int>::Inner\e<bool>\fP
(\fI\%template<> template<> Outer<int>::Inner<bool>\fP).  As a
shorthand the empty template parameter list can be omitted, e.g.,
\fBOuter\e<int>\fP (\fI\%Outer<int>\fP) and \fBOuter\e<int>::Inner\e<bool>\fP
(\fI\%Outer<int>::Inner<bool>\fP).
.SS Partial Template Specialisations
.sp
Assume the following declaration.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B template<typename T> class Outer<\fI\%T\fP*> 
.UNINDENT
.sp
References to partial specialisations must always include the template
parameter lists, e.g., \fBtemplate\e<typename T> Outer\e<T*>\fP
(\fI\%template<typename T> Outer<T*>\fP).  Currently the lookup only
succeed if the template parameter identifiers are equal strings.

.SS Python Signatures
.sp
Signatures of functions, methods and class constructors can be given like they
would be written in Python.
.sp
Default values for optional arguments can be given (but if they contain commas,
they will confuse the signature parser).  Python 3\-style argument annotations
can also be given as well as return type annotations:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. py:function:: compile(source : string, filename, symbol=\(aqfile\(aq) \-> ast object
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For functions with optional parameters that don\(aqt have default values
(typically functions implemented in C extension modules without keyword
argument support), you can use brackets to specify the optional parts:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B compile(source[, filename[, symbol]])
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is customary to put the opening bracket before the comma.
.sp
Python 3.12 introduced \fItype parameters\fP, which are type variables
declared directly  within the class or function definition:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
class AnimalList[AnimalT](list[AnimalT]):
   ...

def add[T](a: T, b: T) \-> T:
   return a + b
.EE
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The field names must consist of one of these keywords and an argument (except
for \fBreturns\fP and \fBrtype\fP, which do not need an argument).  This is best
explained by an example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Cross\-referencing Python objects

a matching identifier is found:
.INDENT 0.0

.B :py:mod:
Reference a module; a dotted name may be used.  This should also be used for
package names.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :py:func:
Reference a Python function; dotted names may be used.  The role text needs
not include trailing parentheses to enhance readability; they will be added
automatically by Sphinx if the \fI\%add_function_parentheses\fP config
value is \fBTrue\fP (the default).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

intended to be changed.

.UNINDENT

and the method name; if it occurs within the description of a type, the type
name can be omitted.  A dotted name may be used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :py:attr:

.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :py:obj:
Reference an object of unspecified type.  Useful e.g. as the
\fI\%default_role\fP\&.
.sp
Added in version 0.4.

.UNINDENT
.sp
The name enclosed in this markup can include a module name and/or a class name.
For example, \fB:py:func:\(gafilter\(ga\fP could refer to a function named \fBfilter\fP
in the current module, or the built\-in function of that name.  In contrast,
\fB:py:func:\(gafoo.filter\(ga\fP clearly refers to the \fBfilter\fP function in the
\fBfoo\fP module.
.sp
Normally, names in these roles are searched first without any further
qualification, then with the current module name prepended, then with the
current module and class name (if any) prepended.  If you prefix the name with
a dot, this order is reversed.  For example, in the documentation of Python\(aqs
\X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-codecs'\fI\%codecs\fP\X'tty: link' module, \fB:py:func:\(gaopen\(ga\fP always refers to the built\-in
function, while \fB:py:func:\(ga.open\(ga\fP refers to \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.open'\fI\%codecs.open()\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
A similar heuristic is used to determine whether the name is an attribute of
the currently documented class.
.sp
Also, if the name is prefixed with a dot, and no exact match is found, the
target is taken as a suffix and all object names with that suffix are searched.
For example, \fB:py:meth:\(ga.TarFile.close\(ga\fP references the
\fBtarfile.TarFile.close()\fP function, even if the current module is not
\fBtarfile\fP\&.  Since this can get ambiguous, if there is more than one possible
match, you will get a warning from Sphinx.
.sp
Note that you can combine the \fB~\fP and \fB\&.\fP prefixes:
\fB:py:meth:\(ga~.TarFile.close\(ga\fP will reference the \fBtarfile.TarFile.close()\fP
method, but the visible link caption will only be \fBclose()\fP\&.

Since many projects will need special features in their documentation, Sphinx
allows adding \(dqextensions\(dq to the build process, each of which can modify
almost any aspect of document processing.
.sp
This chapter describes the extensions bundled with Sphinx.  For the API
documentation on writing your own extension, refer to \fI\%Sphinx API\fP\&.
.SS Built\-in extensions
.sp
These extensions are built in and can be activated by respective entries in the
\fI\%extensions\fP configuration value:
.SS \fI\%sphinx.ext.autodoc\fP \-\- Include documentation from docstrings
.sp
This extension can import the modules you are documenting, and pull in
documentation from docstrings in a semi\-automatic way.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fI\%autodoc\fP \fBimports\fP the modules to be documented.  If any
modules have side effects on import, these will be executed by \fBautodoc\fP
when \fBsphinx\-build\fP is run.
.sp
If you document scripts (as opposed to library modules), make sure their main
routine is protected by a \fBif __name__ == \(aq__main__\(aq\fP condition.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For this to work, the docstrings must of course be written in correct
reStructuredText.  You can then use all of the usual Sphinx markup in the
docstrings, and it will end up correctly in the documentation.  Together with
hand\-written documentation, this technique eases the pain of having to maintain
two locations for documentation, while at the same time avoiding
auto\-generated\-looking pure API documentation.
.sp
If you prefer \X'tty: link https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard'\fI\%NumPy\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings'\fI\%Google\fP\X'tty: link' style docstrings over reStructuredText,
you can also enable the \fI\%napoleon\fP extension.
\fI\%napoleon\fP is a preprocessor that converts your
docstrings to correct reStructuredText before \fBautodoc\fP processes them.
.SS Getting started
.SS Setup
.sp
Activate the plugin by adding \fB\(aqsphinx.ext.autodoc\(aq\fP to the \fI\%extensions\fP
in your \fBconf.py\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
extensions = [
    ...
    \(aqsphinx.ext.autodoc\(aq,
]
.EE

.SS Ensuring the code can be imported
.sp
\fI\%autodoc\fP analyses the code and docstrings by introspection after
importing the modules. For importing to work, you have to make sure that your
modules can be found by Sphinx and that dependencies can be resolved (if your
module does \fBimport foo\fP, but \fBfoo\fP is not available in the python environment
that Sphinx runs in, your module import will fail).
.sp
There are two ways to ensure this:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Use an environment that contains your package and Sphinx. This can e.g. be your
local dev environment (with an editable install), or an environment in CI in
which you install Sphinx and your package. The regular installation process
ensures that your package can be found by Sphinx and that all dependencies are
available.
.IP 2. 3
It is alternatively possible to patch the Sphinx run so that it can operate
directly on the sources; e.g. if you want to be able to do a Sphinx build from a
source checkout.
.INDENT 3.0
.IP \(bu 2
Patch \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path'\fI\%sys.path\fP\X'tty: link' in your Sphinx \fBconf.py\fP to include the folder of
your sources. E.g. if you have a repository structure with \fBdoc/conf.py\fP
and your package is at \fBsrc/mypackage\fP, then you should add:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(\(aq../src\(aq))
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
to your \fBconf.py\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To cope with missing dependencies, specify the missing modules in
\fI\%autodoc_mock_imports\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Usage
.sp
You can now use the \fI\%Directives\fP to add formatted documentation for
Python code elements like functions, classes, modules, etc. For example, to document
the function \fBio.open()\fP, reading its signature and docstring from the source file,
you\(aqd write
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. autofunction:: io.open
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also document whole classes or even modules automatically, using member
options for the auto directives, like
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. automodule:: io
   :members:
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Directives
.sp
\fBautodoc\fP provides several directives that are versions of the usual
\fI\%py:module\fP, \fI\%py:class\fP and so forth.  On parsing time, they
import the corresponding module and extract the docstring of the given objects,
inserting them into the page source under a suitable \fI\%py:module\fP,
\fI\%py:class\fP etc.  directive.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Just as \fI\%py:class\fP respects the current \fI\%py:module\fP,
\fI\%autoclass\fP will also do so.  Likewise, \fI\%automethod\fP will
respect the current \fI\%py:class\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. automodule::
.TP
.B \&.. autoclass::
.TP
.B \&.. autoexception::
Document a module, class or exception.  All three directives will by default
only insert the docstring of the object itself:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. autoclass:: Noodle
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will produce source like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. class:: Noodle

   Noodle\(aqs docstring.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \(dqauto\(dq directives can also contain content of their own, it will be
inserted into the resulting non\-auto directive source after the docstring
(but before any automatic member documentation).
.sp
Therefore, you can also mix automatic and non\-automatic member documentation,
like so:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. autoclass:: Noodle
   :members: eat, slurp

   .. method:: boil(time=10)

      Boil the noodle *time* minutes.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Options
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B :members: (no value or comma separated list)
If set, autodoc will generate document for the members of the target
module, class or exception.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. automodule:: noodle
   :members:
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. autoclass:: Noodle
   :members:
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will document all class member methods and properties.
.sp
By default, autodoc will not generate document for the members that are
private, not having docstrings, inherited from super class, or special
members.
.sp
For modules, \fB__all__\fP will be respected when looking for members unless
you give the \fBignore\-module\-all\fP flag option.  Without
\fBignore\-module\-all\fP, the order of the members will also be the order in
\fB__all__\fP\&.
.sp
You can also give an explicit list of members; only these will then be
documented:

For classes and exceptions, members inherited from base classes will be

.sp
.EX
\&.. autoclass:: Noodle

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This can be combined with \fBundoc\-members\fP to document \fIall\fP available
members of the class or module.
.sp
It can take an ancestor class not to document inherited members from it.
By default, members of \fBobject\fP class are not documented.  To show them
all, give \fBNone\fP to the option.
.sp
For example; If your class \fBFoo\fP is derived from \fBlist\fP class and
you don\(aqt want to document \fBlist.__len__()\fP, you should specify a
option \fB:inherited\-members: list\fP to avoid special members of list
class.
.sp
Another example; If your class Foo has \fB__str__\fP special method and
autodoc directive has both \fBinherited\-members\fP and \fBspecial\-members\fP,
\fB__str__\fP will be documented as in the past, but other special method
that are not implemented in your class \fBFoo\fP\&.
.sp
Since v5.0, it can take a comma separated list of ancestor classes.  It
allows to suppress inherited members of several classes on the module at
once by specifying the option to \fI\%automodule\fP directive.
.sp
Note: this will lead to markup errors if the inherited members come from a
module whose docstrings are not reST formatted.

Functions imported from C modules cannot be introspected, and therefore the
signature for such functions cannot be automatically determined.  However, it
is an often\-used convention to put the signature into the first line of the
function\(aqs docstring.
.sp
If this boolean value is set to \fBTrue\fP (which is the default), autodoc will
look at the first line of the docstring for functions and methods, and if it
looks like a signature, use the line as the signature and remove it from the
docstring content.
.sp
autodoc will continue to look for multiple signature lines,
stopping at the first line that does not look like a signature.
This is useful for declaring overloaded function signatures.

.SS \fI\%sphinx.ext.doctest\fP \-\- Test snippets in the documentation
.sp
It is often helpful to include snippets of code in your documentation and
demonstrate the results of executing them. But it is important to ensure that
the documentation stays up\-to\-date with the code.
.sp
This extension allows you to test such code snippets in the documentation in
a natural way.  If you mark the code blocks as shown here, the \fBdoctest\fP
builder will collect them and run them as doctest tests.
.sp
Within each document, you can assign each snippet to a \fIgroup\fP\&. Each group
consists of:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
zero or more \fIsetup code\fP blocks (e.g. importing the module to test)
.IP \(bu 2
one or more \fItest\fP blocks
.UNINDENT
.sp
When building the docs with the \fBdoctest\fP builder, groups are collected for
each document and run one after the other, first executing setup code blocks,
then the test blocks in the order they appear in the file.
.sp
There are two kinds of test blocks:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIdoctest\-style\fP blocks mimic interactive sessions by interleaving Python code
(including the interpreter prompt) and output.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIcode\-output\-style\fP blocks consist of an ordinary piece of Python code, and
optionally, a piece of output for that code.
.UNINDENT
.SS Directives
.sp
The \fIgroup\fP argument below is interpreted as follows: if it is empty, the block
is assigned to the group named \fBdefault\fP\&.  If it is \fB*\fP, the block is
assigned to all groups (including the \fBdefault\fP group).  Otherwise, it must be
a comma\-separated list of group names.
.INDENT 0.0

.B \&.. testsetup:: [group]
A setup code block.  This code is not shown in the output for other builders,
but executed before the doctests of the group(s) it belongs to.
.UNINDENT

.B \&.. testcleanup:: [group]

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

controlling how actual output is compared with what you give as output.  The
default set of flags is specified by the \fI\%doctest_default_flags\fP
configuration variable.
.sp
This directive supports five options:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhide\fP, a flag option, hides the doctest block in other builders.  By
default it is shown as a highlighted doctest block.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBoptions\fP, a string option, can be used to give a comma\-separated list of
doctest flags that apply to each example in the tests.  (You still can give
explicit flags per example, with doctest comments, but they will show up in
other builders too.)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpyversion\fP, a string option, can be used to specify the required Python
version for the example to be tested. For instance, in the following case
the example will be tested only for Python versions greater than 3.10:

individually.  Default is \fBtrim\-doctest\-flags\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that like with standard doctests, you have to use \fB<BLANKLINE>\fP to
signal a blank line in the expected output.  The \fB<BLANKLINE>\fP is removed
when building presentation output (HTML, LaTeX etc.).

\fBskipif\fP, a string option, can be used to skip directives conditionally. This
may be useful e.g. when a different set of tests should be run depending on the
environment (hardware, network/VPN, optional dependencies or different versions
of dependencies). The \fBskipif\fP option is supported by all of the doctest
directives. Below are typical use cases for \fBskipif\fP when used for different
directives:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

result is a true value, the directive is omitted from the test run just as if
it wasn\(aqt present in the file at all.

If this is a nonempty string (the default is \fB\(aqdefault\(aq\fP), standard reST

reST doctest blocks are simply doctests put into a paragraph of their own,

If this value is left at its default value, the above snippet is interpreted

.sp
This extension is meant to help with the common pattern of having many external
links that point to URLs on one and the same site, e.g. links to bug trackers,
version control web interfaces, or simply subpages in other websites.  It does
so by providing aliases to base URLs, so that you only need to give the subpage
name when creating a link.
.sp
Let\(aqs assume that you want to include many links to issues at the Sphinx
tracker, at \fBhttps://github.com/sphinx\-doc/sphinx/issues/\fP\fInum\fP\&.  Typing
this URL again and again is tedious, so you can use \fI\%extlinks\fP

This config value must be a dictionary of external sites, mapping unique
short alias names to a \fIbase URL\fP and a \fIcaption\fP\&.  For example, to create an
alias for the above mentioned issues, you would add
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
extlinks = {\(aqissue\(aq: (\(aqhttps://github.com/sphinx\-doc/sphinx/issues/%s\(aq,
                      \(aqissue %s\(aq)}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. \fB:issue:\(ga123\(ga\fP\&.  This
then inserts a link to \X'tty: link https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/123'\fI\%https://github.com/sphinx\-doc/sphinx/issues/123\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
As you can see, the target given in the role is substituted in the \fIbase URL\fP
in the place of \fB%s\fP\&.
.sp
The link caption depends on the second item in the tuple, the \fIcaption\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
If \fIcaption\fP is \fBNone\fP, the link caption is the full URL.
.IP \(bu 2
If \fIcaption\fP is a string, then it must contain \fB%s\fP exactly once.  In
this case the link caption is \fIcaption\fP with the partial URL substituted
for \fB%s\fP \-\- in the above example, the link caption would be
\fBissue 123\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To produce a literal \fB%\fP in either \fIbase URL\fP or \fIcaption\fP, use \fB%%\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
extlinks = {\(aqKnR\(aq: (\(aqhttps://example.org/K%%26R/page/%s\(aq,
                      \(aq[K&R; page %s]\(aq)}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also use the usual \(dqexplicit title\(dq syntax supported by other roles
that generate links, i.e. \fB:issue:\(gathis issue <123>\(ga\fP\&.  In this case, the
\fIcaption\fP is not relevant.
.sp
Changed in version 4.0: Support to substitute by \(aq%s\(aq in the caption.

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

This extension allows you to embed \X'tty: link https://graphviz.org/'\fI\%Graphviz\fP\X'tty: link' graphs in
your documents.
.sp
It adds these directives:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. graphviz::
Directive to embed graphviz code.  The input code for \fBdot\fP is given as the

Since this setting is not portable from system to system, it is normally not
useful to set it in \fBconf.py\fP; rather, giving it on the

This directive is designed to control only content of document.  It could
not control sections, labels and so on.
.UNINDENT

configuration (that is, all registered variables from \fBconf.py\fP are
available).
.sp
For example, one could write
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS \fI\%sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram\fP \-\- Include inheritance diagrams
.sp
Added in version 0.6.

.sp
This extension allows you to include inheritance diagrams, rendered via the
\fI\%Graphviz extension\fP\&.
.sp
It adds this directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \&.. inheritance\-diagram::
This directive has one or more arguments, each giving a module or class
name.  Class names can be unqualified; in that case they are taken to exist
in the currently described module (see \fI\%py:module\fP).
.sp
For each given class, and each class in each given module, the base classes
are determined.  Then, from all classes and their base classes, a graph is
generated which is then rendered via the graphviz extension to a directed
graph.
.sp
This directive supports an option called \fBparts\fP that, if given, must be an
integer, advising the directive to keep that many dot\-separated parts
in the displayed names (from right to left). For example, \fBparts=1\fP will
only display class names, without the names of the modules that contain
them.
.sp
Changed in version 2.0: The value of for \fBparts\fP can also be negative, indicating how many
parts to drop from the left.  For example, if all your class names start
with \fBlib.\fP, you can give \fB:parts: \-1\fP to remove that prefix from the
displayed node names.

.sp
The directive also supports a \fBprivate\-bases\fP flag option; if given,
private base classes (those whose name starts with \fB_\fP) will be included.
.sp
You can use \fBcaption\fP option to give a caption to the diagram.
.sp
Changed in version 1.1: Added \fBprivate\-bases\fP option; previously, all bases were always
included.

.sp
Changed in version 1.5: Added \fBcaption\fP option

.sp
It also supports a \fBtop\-classes\fP option which requires one or more class
names separated by comma. If specified inheritance traversal will stop at the
specified class names. Given the following Python module:

.SS \fI\%sphinx.ext.intersphinx\fP \-\- Link to other projects\(aq documentation
.sp
Added in version 0.5.

.sp
This extension can generate links to the documentation of objects in external
projects, either explicitly through the \fI\%external\fP role, or as a
fallback resolution for any other cross\-reference.
.sp
Usage for fallback resolution is simple: whenever Sphinx encounters a
cross\-reference that has no matching target in the current documentation set,
it looks for targets in the external documentation sets configured in
\fI\%intersphinx_mapping\fP\&.  A reference like
\fB:py:class:\(gazipfile.ZipFile\(ga\fP can then link to the Python documentation
for the ZipFile class, without you having to specify where it is located
exactly.
.sp
When using the \fI\%external\fP role, you can force lookup to any external
projects, and optionally to a specific external project.
A link like \fB:external:ref:\(gacomparison manual <comparisons>\(ga\fP will then link
to the label \(dqcomparisons\(dq in whichever configured external project, if it
exists,
and a link like \fB:external+python:ref:\(gacomparison manual <comparisons>\(ga\fP will
link to the label \(dqcomparisons\(dq only in the doc set \(dqpython\(dq, if it exists.
.sp
Behind the scenes, this works as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Each Sphinx HTML build creates a file named \fBobjects.inv\fP that contains
a mapping from object names to URIs relative to the HTML set\(aqs root.
.IP \(bu 2
Projects using the Intersphinx extension can specify the location of such
mapping files in the \fI\%intersphinx_mapping\fP config value.  The mapping
will then be used to resolve both \fI\%external\fP references, and also
otherwise missing references to objects into links to the other documentation.
.IP \(bu 2
By default, the mapping file is assumed to be at the same location as the rest
of the documentation; however, the location of the mapping file can also be
specified individually, e.g. if the docs should be buildable without Internet
access.
.UNINDENT
.SS Configuration
.sp

.B intersphinx_mapping
This config value contains the locations and names of other projects that
should be linked to in this documentation.
.sp
Relative local paths for target locations are taken as relative to the base
of the built documentation, while relative local paths for inventory
locations are taken as relative to the source directory.
.sp
When fetching remote inventory files, proxy settings will be read from
the \fB$HTTP_PROXY\fP environment variable.
.sp
\fBFormat\fP
.sp
Added in version 1.0.

.sp
A dictionary mapping unique identifiers to a tuple \fB(target, inventory)\fP\&.
Each \fBtarget\fP is the base URI of a foreign Sphinx documentation set and can
be a local path or an HTTP URI.  The \fBinventory\fP indicates where the
inventory file can be found: it can be \fBNone\fP (an \fBobjects.inv\fP file
at the same location as the base URI) or another local file path or a full
HTTP URI to an inventory file.
.sp
The unique identifier can be used in the \fI\%external\fP role, so that
it is clear which intersphinx set the target belongs to.  A link like
\fBexternal:python+ref:\(gacomparison manual <comparisons>\(ga\fP will link to the
label \(dqcomparisons\(dq in the doc set \(dqpython\(dq, if it exists.
.sp
\fBExample\fP
.sp
To add links to modules and objects in the Python standard library
documentation, use:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
intersphinx_mapping = {\(aqpython\(aq: (\(aqhttps://docs.python.org/3\(aq, None)}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will download the corresponding \fBobjects.inv\fP file from the
Internet and generate links to the pages under the given URI.  The downloaded
inventory is cached in the Sphinx environment, so it must be re\-downloaded
whenever you do a full rebuild.
.sp
A second example, showing the meaning of a non\-\fBNone\fP value of the second
tuple item:
.INDENT 7.0

as new objects are added to the Python documentation.
.sp
\fBMultiple targets for the inventory\fP

A list of strings being either:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
the name of a specific reference type in a domain,
e.g., \fBstd:doc\fP, \fBpy:func\fP, or \fBcpp:class\fP,

The Intersphinx extension provides the following role.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B :external:
Added in version 4.4.

.sp
Use Intersphinx to perform lookup only in external projects, and not the
current project. Intersphinx still needs to know the type of object you
would like to find, so the general form of this role is to write the
cross\-refererence as if the object is in the current project, but then prefix
it with \fB:external\fP\&.
The two forms are then
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB:external:domain:reftype:\(gatarget\(ga\fP,
e.g., \fB:external:py:class:\(gazipfile.ZipFile\(ga\fP, or
.IP \(bu 2
\fB:external:reftype:\(gatarget\(ga\fP,
e.g., \fB:external:doc:\(gainstallation\(ga\fP\&.
With this shorthand, the domain is assumed to be \fBstd\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you would like to constrain the lookup to a specific external project,
then the key of the project, as specified in \fI\%intersphinx_mapping\fP,
is added as well to get the two forms
.INDENT 7.0

This extension looks at your object descriptions (\fB\&.. class::\fP,

somewhere on the web. The intent is similar to the
\fBsphinx.ext.viewcode\fP extension, but assumes the source code can be
found somewhere on the Internet.

In your configuration, you need to specify a \fI\%linkcode_resolve\fP
function that returns an URL based on the object.

This is a function \fBlinkcode_resolve(domain, info)\fP,
which should return the URL to source code corresponding to

.sp
Added in version 0.5.

.sp
Changed in version 1.8: Math support for non\-HTML builders is integrated to sphinx\-core.
So mathbase extension is no longer needed.

.sp
Since mathematical notation isn\(aqt natively supported by HTML in any way, Sphinx
gives a math support to HTML document with several extensions.  These use the
reStructuredText math \fI\%directive\fP and \fI\%role\fP\&.
.SS \fI\%sphinx.ext.imgmath\fP \-\- Render math as images

images. This of course means that the computer where the docs are built must
have both programs available.
.sp
There are various configuration values you can set to influence how the images
are built:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B imgmath_image_format
The output image format. The default is \fB\(aqpng\(aq\fP\&. It should be either
\fB\(aqpng\(aq\fP or \fB\(aqsvg\(aq\fP\&. The image is produced by first executing \fBlatex\fP
on the TeX mathematical mark\-up then (depending on the requested format)
either \X'tty: link https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/dvipng/'\fI\%dvipng\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link https://dvisvgm.de/'\fI\%dvisvgm\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B imgmath_use_preview
\fBdvipng\fP and \fBdvisvgm\fP both have the ability to collect from LaTeX the
\(dqdepth\(dq of the rendered math: an inline image should use this \(dqdepth\(dq in a
\fBvertical\-align\fP style to get correctly aligned with surrounding text.
.sp
This mechanism requires the \X'tty: link https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/preview-latex.html'\fI\%LaTeX preview package\fP\X'tty: link' (available as
\fBpreview\-latex\-style\fP on Ubuntu xenial).  Therefore, the default for this
option is \fBFalse\fP but it is strongly recommended to set it to \fBTrue\fP\&.

.UNINDENT

\fB12\fP\&.  It must be a positive integer.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B imgmath_latex
The command name with which to invoke LaTeX.  The default is \fB\(aqlatex\(aq\fP; you
may need to set this to a full path if \fBlatex\fP is not in the executable
search path.
.sp
Since this setting is not portable from system to system, it is normally not
useful to set it in \fBconf.py\fP; rather, giving it on the
\fBsphinx\-build\fP command line via the \fI\%\-D\fP
option should be preferable, like this:

.SS Google vs NumPy
.sp
Napoleon supports two styles of docstrings: \X'tty: link https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings'\fI\%Google\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard'\fI\%NumPy\fP\X'tty: link'\&. The
main difference between the two styles is that Google uses indentation to
separate sections, whereas NumPy uses underlines.
.sp
Google style:

NumPy style tends to require more vertical space, whereas Google style
tends to use more horizontal space. Google style tends to be easier to
read for short and simple docstrings, whereas NumPy style tends be easier
to read for long and in\-depth docstrings.
.sp
The choice between styles is largely aesthetic, but the two styles should
not be mixed. Choose one style for your project and be consistent with it.

.SS Type Annotations
.sp
\X'tty: link https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/'\fI\%PEP 484\fP\X'tty: link' introduced a standard way to express types in Python code.
This is an alternative to expressing types directly in docstrings.
One benefit of expressing types according to \X'tty: link https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/'\fI\%PEP 484\fP\X'tty: link' is that
type checkers and IDEs can take advantage of them for static code
analysis. \X'tty: link https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/'\fI\%PEP 484\fP\X'tty: link' was then extended by \X'tty: link https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/'\fI\%PEP 526\fP\X'tty: link' which introduced

You can find several extensions contributed by users in the \X'tty: link https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/'\fI\%sphinx\-contrib\fP\X'tty: link'
organization. If you wish to include your extension in this organization,
simply follow the instructions provided in the \X'tty: link https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/github-administration'\fI\%github\-administration\fP\X'tty: link'
project. This is optional and there are several extensions hosted elsewhere.
The \X'tty: link https://github.com/yoloseem/awesome-sphinxdoc'\fI\%awesome\-sphinxdoc\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link https://sphinx-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'\fI\%sphinx\-extensions\fP\X'tty: link' projects are both curated

.SS Where to put your own extensions?
.sp
Extensions local to a project should be put within the project\(aqs directory
structure.  Set Python\(aqs module search path, \fBsys.path\fP, accordingly so that
Sphinx can find them.  For example, if your extension \fBfoo.py\fP lies in the
\fBexts\fP subdirectory of the project root, put into \fBconf.py\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
import sys, os

sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(\(aqexts\(aq))

extensions = [\(aqfoo\(aq]
.EE

.sp
You can also install extensions anywhere else on \fBsys.path\fP, e.g. in the
\fBsite\-packages\fP directory.

This section provides information about using pre\-existing HTML themes. If
you wish to create your own theme, refer to
\fI\%HTML theme development\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Sphinx supports changing the appearance of its HTML output via \fIthemes\fP\&.  A
theme is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheet(s) and other static files.
Additionally, it has a configuration file which specifies from which theme to
inherit, which highlighting style to use, and what options exist for customizing
the theme\(aqs look and feel.
.sp
Themes are meant to be project\-unaware, so they can be used for different
projects without change.
.SS Using a theme
.sp
Using a \fI\%theme provided with Sphinx\fP is easy. Since these
do not need to be installed, you only need to set the \fI\%html_theme\fP
config value. For example, to enable the \fBclassic\fP theme, add the following
to \fBconf.py\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
html_theme = \(dqclassic\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also set theme\-specific options using the \fI\%html_theme_options\fP
config value.  These options are generally used to change the look and feel of
the theme. For example, to place the sidebar on the right side and a black
background for the relation bar (the bar with the navigation links at the
page\(aqs top and bottom), add the following \fBconf.py\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
html_theme_options = {
    \(dqrightsidebar\(dq: \(dqtrue\(dq,
    \(dqrelbarbgcolor\(dq: \(dqblack\(dq
}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the theme does not come with Sphinx, it can be in two static forms or as a
Python package. For the static forms, either a directory (containing
\fBtheme.toml\fP and other needed files), or a zip file with the same
contents is supported. The directory or zipfile must be put where Sphinx can
find it; for this there is the config value \fI\%html_theme_path\fP\&. This
can be a list of directories, relative to the directory containing
\fBconf.py\fP, that can contain theme directories or zip files.  For example,
if you have a theme in the file \fBblue.zip\fP, you can put it right in the
directory containing \fBconf.py\fP and use this configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
html_theme = \(dqblue\(dq
html_theme_path = [\(dq.\(dq]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The third form is a Python package.  If a theme you want to use is distributed
as a Python package, you can use it after installing
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# installing theme package
$ pip install sphinxjp.themes.dotted
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once installed, this can be used in the same manner as a directory or
zipfile\-based theme:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
html_theme = \(dqdotted\(dq
.EE

.SS Sphinx internationalization details
.sp
\fBgettext\fP [1] is an established standard for internationalization and
localization.  It naively maps messages in a program to a translated string.
Sphinx uses these facilities to translate whole documents.
.sp
Initially project maintainers have to collect all translatable strings (also
referred to as \fImessages\fP) to make them known to translators.  Sphinx extracts
these through invocation of \fBsphinx\-build \-M gettext\fP\&.
.sp
Every single element in the doctree will end up in a single message which
results in lists being equally split into different chunks while large
paragraphs will remain as coarsely\-grained as they were in the original
document.  This grants seamless document updates while still providing a little
bit of context for translators in free\-text passages.  It is the maintainer\(aqs
task to split up paragraphs which are too large as there is no sane automated
way to do that.
.sp
After Sphinx successfully ran the
\fI\%MessageCatalogBuilder\fP you will find a
collection of \fB\&.pot\fP files in your output directory.  These are \fBcatalog
templates\fP and contain messages in your original language \fIonly\fP\&.
.sp
They can be delivered to translators which will transform them to \fB\&.po\fP files
\-\-\- so called \fBmessage catalogs\fP \-\-\- containing a mapping from the original
messages to foreign\-language strings.
.sp
\fIgettext\fP compiles them into a binary format known as \fBbinary catalogs\fP
through \fBmsgfmt\fP for efficiency reasons.  If you make these files
discoverable with \fI\%locale_dirs\fP for your \fI\%language\fP, Sphinx
will pick them up automatically.
.sp
An example: you have a document \fBusage.rst\fP in your Sphinx project.  The
\fIgettext\fP builder will put its messages into \fBusage.pot\fP\&.  Imagine you have
Spanish translations [2] stored in \fBusage.po\fP \-\-\- for your builds to
be translated you need to follow these instructions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Compile your message catalog to a locale directory, say \fBlocale\fP, so it
ends up in \fB\&./locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/usage.mo\fP in your source directory
(where \fBes\fP is the language code for Spanish.)
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

.IP \(bu 2
Set \fI\%locale_dirs\fP to \fB[\(dqlocale/\(dq]\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Set \fI\%language\fP to \fBes\fP (also possible via
\fI\%\-D\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Run your desired build.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In order to protect against mistakes, a warning is emitted if
cross\-references in the translated paragraph do not match those from the
original.  This can be turned off globally using the
\fI\%suppress_warnings\fP configuration variable.  Alternatively, to
turn it off for one message only, end the message with \fB#noqa\fP like
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse
risus tortor, luctus id ultrices at. #noqa
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(Write \fB\e#noqa\fP in case you want to have \(dq#noqa\(dq literally in the
text.  This does not apply to code blocks, where \fB#noqa\fP is ignored
because code blocks do not contain references anyway.)
.sp

.SS Sphinx Web Support
.sp
Added in version 1.1.

.sp
Sphinx provides a Python API to easily integrate Sphinx documentation into your
web application.  To learn more read the \fI\%Web Support Quick Start\fP\&.
.SS Web Support Quick Start
.SS Building Documentation Data
.sp
To make use of the web support package in your application you\(aqll need to build
the data it uses.  This data includes pickle files representing documents,
search indices, and node data that is used to track where comments and other
things are in a document.  To do this you will need to create an instance of the
\fI\%WebSupport\fP class and call its \fBbuild()\fP method:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
from sphinxcontrib.websupport import WebSupport

support = WebSupport(srcdir=\(aq/path/to/rst/sources/\(aq,
                     builddir=\(aq/path/to/build/outdir\(aq,
                     search=\(aqxapian\(aq)

support.build()
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will read reStructuredText sources from \fBsrcdir\fP and place the necessary
data in \fBbuilddir\fP\&.  The \fBbuilddir\fP will contain two sub\-directories: one
named \(dqdata\(dq that contains all the data needed to display documents, search
through documents, and add comments to documents.  The other directory will be
called \(dqstatic\(dq and contains static files that should be served from \(dq/static\(dq.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you wish to serve static files from a path other than \(dq/static\(dq, you can
do so by providing the \fIstaticdir\fP keyword argument when creating the
\fI\%WebSupport\fP object.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Integrating Sphinx Documents Into Your Webapp
.sp
Now that the data is built, it\(aqs time to do something useful with it.  Start off
by creating a \fI\%WebSupport\fP object for your application:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
from sphinxcontrib.websupport import WebSupport

support = WebSupport(datadir=\(aq/path/to/the/data\(aq,
                     search=\(aqxapian\(aq)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You\(aqll only need one of these for each set of documentation you will be working
with.  You can then call its \fBget_document()\fP method to access
individual documents:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
contents = support.get_document(\(aqcontents\(aq)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will return a dictionary containing the following items:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbody\fP: The main body of the document as HTML
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsidebar\fP: The sidebar of the document as HTML
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrelbar\fP: A div containing links to related documents
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtitle\fP: The title of the document
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcss\fP: Links to CSS files used by Sphinx
.IP \(bu 2
\fBscript\fP: JavaScript containing comment options
.UNINDENT
.sp
This dict can then be used as context for templates.  The goal is to be easy to
integrate with your existing templating system.  An example using \X'tty: link https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/'\fI\%Jinja2\fP\X'tty: link' is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

.SS Authentication
.sp
To use certain features such as voting, it must be possible to authenticate
users.  The details of the authentication are left to your application.  Once a
user has been authenticated you can pass the user\(aqs details to certain
\fI\%WebSupport\fP methods using the \fIusername\fP and \fImoderator\fP keyword
arguments.  The web support package will store the username with comments and
votes.  The only caveat is that if you allow users to change their username you
must update the websupport package\(aqs data:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
support.update_username(old_username, new_username)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIusername\fP should be a unique string which identifies a user, and \fImoderator\fP
should be a boolean representing whether the user has moderation privileges.
The default value for \fImoderator\fP is \fBFalse\fP\&.
.sp
An example \X'tty: link https://flask.palletsprojects.com/'\fI\%Flask\fP\X'tty: link' function that checks
whether a user is logged in and then retrieves a document is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
from sphinxcontrib.websupport.errors import *

@app.route(\(aq/<path:docname>\(aq)
def doc(docname):
    username = g.user.name if g.user else \(aq\(aq
    moderator = g.user.moderator if g.user else False
    try:
        document = support.get_document(docname, username, moderator)
    except DocumentNotFoundError:
        abort(404)
    return render_template(\(aqdoc.html\(aq, document=document)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first thing to notice is that the \fIdocname\fP is just the request path.  This
makes accessing the correct document easy from a single view.  If the user is
authenticated, then the username and moderation status are passed along with the
docname to \fBget_document()\fP\&.  The web support package will then
add this data to the \fBCOMMENT_OPTIONS\fP that are used in the template.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This only works if your documentation is served from your
document root. If it is served from another directory, you will
need to prefix the url route with that directory, and give the \fIdocroot\fP
keyword argument when creating the web support object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
support = WebSupport(..., docroot=\(aqdocs\(aq)

@app.route(\(aq/docs/<path:docname>\(aq)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Performing Searches
.sp
To use the search form built\-in to the Sphinx sidebar, create a function to
handle requests to the URL \(aqsearch\(aq relative to the documentation root.  The
user\(aqs search query will be in the GET parameters, with the key \fBq\fP\&.  Then use
the \fBget_search_results()\fP method to
retrieve search results. In \X'tty: link https://flask.palletsprojects.com/'\fI\%Flask\fP\X'tty: link' that
would be like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
@app.route(\(aq/search\(aq)
def search():
    q = request.args.get(\(aqq\(aq)
    document = support.get_search_results(q)
    return render_template(\(aqdoc.html\(aq, document=document)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that we used the same template to render our search results as we did to
render our documents.  That\(aqs because \fBget_search_results()\fP
returns a context dict in the same format that \fBget_document()\fP
does.
.SS Comments & Proposals
.sp
Now that this is done it\(aqs time to define the functions that handle the AJAX
calls from the script.  You will need three functions.  The first function is
used to add a new comment, and will call the web support method
\fBadd_comment()\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
@app.route(\(aq/docs/add_comment\(aq, methods=[\(aqPOST\(aq])
def add_comment():
    parent_id = request.form.get(\(aqparent\(aq, \(aq\(aq)
    node_id = request.form.get(\(aqnode\(aq, \(aq\(aq)
    text = request.form.get(\(aqtext\(aq, \(aq\(aq)
    proposal = request.form.get(\(aqproposal\(aq, \(aq\(aq)
    username = g.user.name if g.user is not None else \(aqAnonymous\(aq
    comment = support.add_comment(text, node_id=\(aqnode_id\(aq,
                                  parent_id=\(aqparent_id\(aq,
                                  username=username, proposal=proposal)
    return jsonify(comment=comment)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You\(aqll notice that both a \fBparent_id\fP and \fBnode_id\fP are sent with the
request. If the comment is being attached directly to a node, \fBparent_id\fP
will be empty. If the comment is a child of another comment, then \fBnode_id\fP
will be empty. Then next function handles the retrieval of comments for a
specific node, and is aptly named
\fBget_data()\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
@app.route(\(aq/docs/get_comments\(aq)
def get_comments():
    username = g.user.name if g.user else None
    moderator = g.user.moderator if g.user else False
    node_id = request.args.get(\(aqnode\(aq, \(aq\(aq)
    data = support.get_data(node_id, username, moderator)
    return jsonify(**data)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The final function that is needed will call \fBprocess_vote()\fP,
and will handle user votes on comments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
@app.route(\(aq/docs/process_vote\(aq, methods=[\(aqPOST\(aq])
def process_vote():
    if g.user is None:
        abort(401)
    comment_id = request.form.get(\(aqcomment_id\(aq)
    value = request.form.get(\(aqvalue\(aq)
    if value is None or comment_id is None:
        abort(400)
    support.process_vote(comment_id, g.user.id, value)
    return \(dqsuccess\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Comment Moderation
.sp
By default, all comments added through \fBadd_comment()\fP are
automatically displayed.  If you wish to have some form of moderation, you can
pass the \fBdisplayed\fP keyword argument:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
comment = support.add_comment(text, node_id=\(aqnode_id\(aq,
                              parent_id=\(aqparent_id\(aq,
                              username=username, proposal=proposal,
                              displayed=False)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can then create a new view to handle the moderation of comments.  It
will be called when a moderator decides a comment should be accepted and
displayed:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
@app.route(\(aq/docs/accept_comment\(aq, methods=[\(aqPOST\(aq])
def accept_comment():
    moderator = g.user.moderator if g.user else False
    comment_id = request.form.get(\(aqid\(aq)
    support.accept_comment(comment_id, moderator=moderator)
    return \(aqOK\(aq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Rejecting comments happens via comment deletion.
.sp
To perform a custom action (such as emailing a moderator) when a new comment is
added but not displayed, you can pass callable to the \fI\%WebSupport\fP
class when instantiating your support object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
def moderation_callback(comment):
    \(dq\(dq\(dqDo something...\(dq\(dq\(dq

support = WebSupport(..., moderation_callback=moderation_callback)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SS The WebSupport Class
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B class sphinxcontrib.websupport.WebSupport
The main API class for the web support package.  All interactions with the
web support package should occur through this class.
.sp
The class takes the following keyword arguments:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B srcdir
The directory containing reStructuredText source files.
.TP
.B builddir
The directory that build data and static files should be placed in.  This
should be used when creating a \fI\%WebSupport\fP object that will be
used to build data.
.TP
.B datadir
The directory that the web support data is in.  This should be used when
creating a \fI\%WebSupport\fP object that will be used to retrieve data.
.TP
.B search
This may contain either a string (e.g. \(aqxapian\(aq) referencing a built\-in
search adapter to use, or an instance of a subclass of
\fI\%BaseSearch\fP\&.
.TP
.B storage
This may contain either a string representing a database uri, or an
instance of a subclass of \fI\%StorageBackend\fP\&.  If this is
not provided, a new sqlite database will be created.
.TP
.B moderation_callback
A callable to be called when a new comment is added that is not
displayed.  It must accept one argument: a dictionary representing the
comment that was added.
.TP
.B staticdir
If the static files should be created in a different location
\fBand not in\fP \fB\(aq/static\(aq\fP, this should be a string with the name of
that location (e.g. \fBbuilddir + \(aq/static_files\(aq\fP).

.B staticroot
If the static files are not served from \fB\(aq/static\(aq\fP, this should be a
string with the name of that location (e.g. \fB\(aq/static_files\(aq\fP).

.SS Methods
.SS Search Adapters
.sp
To create a custom search adapter you will need to subclass the
\fI\%BaseSearch\fP class.  Then create an instance of the new class and pass
that as the \fIsearch\fP keyword argument when you create the \fI\%WebSupport\fP
object:

.UNINDENT
.sp
Changed in version 1.6: BaseSearch class is moved to sphinxcontrib.websupport.search from
sphinx.websupport.search.

.SS Methods
.sp
The following methods are defined in the BaseSearch class. Some methods do not
need to be overridden, but some (\fBadd_document()\fP and
\fBhandle_query()\fP) must be overridden in your subclass. For a
working example, look at the built\-in adapter for whoosh.
.SS Storage Backends
.sp
To create a custom storage backend you will need to subclass the
\fI\%StorageBackend\fP class.  Then create an instance of the new class and
pass that as the \fIstorage\fP keyword argument when you create the
\fI\%WebSupport\fP object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
support = WebSupport(srcdir=srcdir,

.SS Extending Sphinx
.sp
This guide is aimed at giving a quick introduction for those wishing to
develop their own extensions for Sphinx.
Sphinx possesses significant extensibility capabilities
including the ability to hook into almost every point of the build process.
If you simply wish to use Sphinx with existing extensions,
refer to \fI\%Using Sphinx\fP\&.
For a more detailed discussion of the extension interface see \fI\%Sphinx API\fP\&.
.SS Tutorials
.SS Extending syntax with roles and directives
.SS Overview
.sp
The syntax of both reStructuredText and MyST can be extended
by creating new \fBdirectives\fP \- for block\-level elements \-
and \fBroles\fP \- for inline elements.
.sp
In this tutorial we shall extend Sphinx to add:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBhello\fP role, that will simply output the text \fBHello {text}!\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBhello\fP directive, that will simply output the text \fBHello {text}!\fP,
as a paragraph.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For this extension, you will need some basic understanding of Python,
and we shall also introduce aspects of the \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/'\fI\%docutils\fP\X'tty: link' API.
.SS Setting up the project
.sp
You can either use an existing Sphinx project
or create a new one using \fBsphinx\-quickstart\fP\&.
.sp
With this we will add the extension to the project,
within the \fBsource\fP folder:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Create an \fB_ext\fP folder in \fBsource\fP
.IP 2. 3
Create a new Python file in the \fB_ext\fP folder called
\fBhelloworld.py\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here is an example of the folder structure you might obtain:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

 \ \  ├── _ext
    │ \  └── helloworld.py
 \ \  ├── conf.py

.SS Writing the extension
.sp
Open \fBhelloworld.py\fP and paste the following code in it:
.INDENT 0.0

from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from sphinx.util.docutils import SphinxDirective, SphinxRole

class HelloRole(SphinxRole):
    \(dq\(dq\(dqA role to say hello!\(dq\(dq\(dq

    def run(self) \-> tuple[list[nodes.Node], list[nodes.system_message]]:
        node = nodes.inline(text=f\(aqHello {self.text}!\(aq)

        \(aqparallel_write_safe\(aq: True,
    }

Some essential things are happening in this example:
.SS The role class
.sp
Our new role is declared in the \fBHelloRole\fP class.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
class HelloRole(SphinxRole):

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This class extends the \fI\%SphinxRole\fP class.
The class contains a \fBrun\fP method,
which is a requirement for every role.
It contains the main logic of the role and it
returns a tuple containing:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a list of inline\-level docutils nodes to be processed by Sphinx.
.IP \(bu 2
an (optional) list of system message nodes
.UNINDENT
.SS The directive class
.sp
Our new directive is declared in the \fBHelloDirective\fP class.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.EX
class HelloDirective(SphinxDirective):
    \(dq\(dq\(dqA directive to say hello!\(dq\(dq\(dq

    required_arguments = 1

    def run(self) \-> list[nodes.Node]:
        paragraph_node = nodes.paragraph(text=f\(aqhello {self.arguments[0]}!\(aq)
        return [paragraph_node]

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This class extends the \fI\%SphinxDirective\fP class.
The class contains a \fBrun\fP method,
which is a requirement for every directive.
It contains the main logic of the directive and it
returns a list of block\-level docutils nodes to be processed by Sphinx.
It also contains a \fBrequired_arguments\fP attribute,
which tells Sphinx how many arguments are required for the directive.
.SS What are docutils nodes?
.sp
When Sphinx parses a document,
it creates an \(dqAbstract Syntax Tree\(dq (AST) of nodes
that represent the content of the document in a structured way,
that is generally independent of any one
input (rST, MyST, etc) or output (HTML, LaTeX, etc) format.
It is a tree because each node can have children nodes, and so on:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
<document>
   <paragraph>
      <text>
         Hello world!
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/'\fI\%docutils\fP\X'tty: link' package provides many \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/doctree.html'\fI\%built\-in nodes\fP\X'tty: link',
to represent different types of content such as
text, paragraphs, references, tables, etc.
.sp
Each node type generally only accepts a specific set of direct child nodes,
for example the \fBdocument\fP node should only contain \(dqblock\-level\(dq nodes,
such as \fBparagraph\fP, \fBsection\fP, \fBtable\fP, etc,
whilst the \fBparagraph\fP node should only contain \(dqinline\-level\(dq nodes,
such as \fBtext\fP, \fBemphasis\fP, \fBstrong\fP, etc.
.sp

.SS The \fBsetup\fP function

This function is a requirement.
We use it to plug our new directive into Sphinx.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
def setup(app: Sphinx) \-> ExtensionMetadata:
    app.add_role(\(aqhello\(aq, HelloRole())
    app.add_directive(\(aqhello\(aq, HelloDirective)

    return {
        \(aqversion\(aq: \(aq0.1\(aq,

        \(aqparallel_write_safe\(aq: True,
    }

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The simplest thing you can do is to call the
\fI\%Sphinx.add_role()\fP and \fI\%Sphinx.add_directive()\fP methods,
which is what we\(aqve done here.
For this particular call, the first argument is the name of the role/directive itself
as used in a reST file.
In this case, we would use \fBhello\fP\&. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Some intro text here...

\&.. hello:: world

Some text with a :hello:\(gaworld\(ga role.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We also return the \fI\%extension metadata\fP that indicates the
version of our extension, along with the fact that it is safe to use the
extension for both parallel reading and writing.
.SS Using the extension
.sp
The extension has to be declared in your \fBconf.py\fP file to make Sphinx
aware of it. There are two steps necessary here:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Add the \fB_ext\fP directory to the \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH'\fI\%Python path\fP\X'tty: link' using
\fBsys.path.append\fP\&. This should be placed at the top of the file.
.IP 2. 3
Update or create the \fI\%extensions\fP list and add the extension file
name to the list
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
import os
import sys

sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(\(dq./_ext\(dq))

extensions = [\(aqhelloworld\(aq]
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBTIP:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Because we haven\(aqt installed our extension as a \X'tty: link https://packaging.python.org/'\fI\%Python package\fP\X'tty: link', we need to
modify the \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH'\fI\%Python path\fP\X'tty: link' so Sphinx can find our extension. This is why we
need the call to \fBsys.path.append\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can now use the extension in a file. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Some intro text here...

\&.. hello:: world

Some text with a :hello:\(gaworld\(ga role.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The sample above would generate:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Some intro text here...

Hello world!

Some text with a hello world! role.
.EE

.SS Further reading
.sp
This is the very basic principle of an extension
that creates a new role and directive.
.sp
For a more advanced example, refer to \fI\%Extending the build process\fP\&.
.sp
If you wish to share your extension across multiple projects or with others,
check out the \fI\%Third\-party extensions\fP section.
.SS Extending the build process
.sp
The objective of this tutorial is to create a more comprehensive extension than
that created in \fI\%Extending syntax with roles and directives\fP\&.
Whereas that guide just covered writing
a custom \fI\%role\fP and \fI\%directive\fP,
this guide covers a more complex extension to the Sphinx build process;
adding multiple directives,
along with custom nodes, additional config values and custom event handlers.
.sp
To this end, we will cover a \fBtodo\fP extension
that adds capabilities to include todo entries in the documentation,
and to collect these in a central place.
This is similar to the \fI\%sphinx.ext.todo\fP extension distributed with Sphinx.
.SS Overview
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
To understand the design of this extension, refer to
\fI\%Important objects\fP and \fI\%Build Phases\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We want the extension to add the following to Sphinx:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBtodo\fP directive, containing some content that is marked with \(dqTODO\(dq and
only shown in the output if a new config value is set. Todo entries should not
be in the output by default.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBtodolist\fP directive that creates a list of all todo entries throughout
the documentation.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For that, we will need to add the following elements to Sphinx:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
New directives, called \fBtodo\fP and \fBtodolist\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
New document tree nodes to represent these directives, conventionally also
called \fBtodo\fP and \fBtodolist\fP\&.  We wouldn\(aqt need new nodes if the new
directives only produced some content representable by existing nodes.
.IP \(bu 2
A new config value \fBtodo_include_todos\fP (config value names should start
with the extension name, in order to stay unique) that controls whether todo
entries make it into the output.
.IP \(bu 2
New event handlers: one for the \fI\%doctree\-resolved\fP event, to
replace the todo and todolist nodes, one for \fI\%env\-merge\-info\fP
to merge intermediate results from parallel builds, and one for
\fI\%env\-purge\-doc\fP (the reason for that will be covered later).
.UNINDENT
.SS Prerequisites
.sp
As with \fI\%Extending syntax with roles and directives\fP,
we will not be distributing this plugin via PyPI so
once again we need a Sphinx project to call this from. You can use an existing
project or create a new one using \fBsphinx\-quickstart\fP\&.
.sp
We assume you are using separate source (\fBsource\fP) and build
(\fBbuild\fP) folders. Your extension file could be in any folder of your
project. In our case, let\(aqs do the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Create an \fB_ext\fP folder in \fBsource\fP
.IP 2. 3
Create a new Python file in the \fB_ext\fP folder called \fBtodo.py\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here is an example of the folder structure you might obtain:

It is important to know that while you can extend Sphinx without
leaving your \fBconf.py\fP, if you declare an inherited node right
there, you\(aqll hit an unobvious \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PickleError'\fI\%PickleError\fP\X'tty: link'\&. So if
something goes wrong, please make sure that you put inherited nodes
into a separate Python module.

The directive classes
.sp
A directive class is a class deriving usually from
\fI\%docutils.parsers.rst.Directive\fP\&. The directive interface is also
covered in detail in the \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html'\fI\%docutils documentation\fP\X'tty: link'; the important thing is that
the class should have attributes that configure the allowed markup, and a
\fBrun\fP method that returns a list of nodes.
.sp
Looking first at the \fBTodolistDirective\fP directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX


class TodolistDirective(Directive):
    def run(self):

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It\(aqs very simple, creating and returning an instance of our \fBtodolist\fP node
class.  The \fBTodolistDirective\fP directive itself has neither content nor
arguments that need to be handled. That brings us to the \fBTodoDirective\fP
directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

class TodoDirective(SphinxDirective):
    # this enables content in the directive
    has_content = True

    def run(self):
        targetid = \(aqtodo\-%d\(aq % self.env.new_serialno(\(aqtodo\(aq)
        targetnode = nodes.target(\(aq\(aq, \(aq\(aq, ids=[targetid])

        todo_node = todo(\(aq\en\(aq.join(self.content))
        todo_node += nodes.title(_(\(aqTodo\(aq), _(\(aqTodo\(aq))
        todo_node += self.parse_content_to_nodes()

        if not hasattr(self.env, \(aqtodo_all_todos\(aq):
            self.env.todo_all_todos = []

        self.env.todo_all_todos.append({
            \(aqdocname\(aq: self.env.docname,
            \(aqlineno\(aq: self.lineno,
            \(aqtodo\(aq: todo_node.deepcopy(),
            \(aqtarget\(aq: targetnode,
        })

        return [targetnode, todo_node]

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Several important things are covered here. First, as you can see, we\(aqre now
subclassing the \fI\%SphinxDirective\fP helper class
instead of the usual \fI\%Directive\fP class. This
gives us access to the \fI\%build environment instance\fP
using the \fBself.env\fP property. Without this, we\(aqd have to use the rather
convoluted \fBself.state.document.settings.env\fP\&. Then, to act as a link target
(from \fBTodolistDirective\fP), the \fBTodoDirective\fP directive needs to return a
target node in addition to the \fBtodo\fP node.  The target ID (in HTML, this will
be the anchor name) is generated by using \fBenv.new_serialno\fP which returns a
new unique integer on each call and therefore leads to unique target names. The
target node is instantiated without any text (the first two arguments).
.sp
On creating admonition node, the content body of the directive are parsed using
\fBself.state.nested_parse\fP\&.  The first argument gives the content body, and
the second one gives content offset.  The third argument gives the parent node
of parsed result, in our case the \fBtodo\fP node. Following this, the \fBtodo\fP
node is added to the environment.  This is needed to be able to create a list of
all todo entries throughout the documentation, in the place where the author
puts a \fBtodolist\fP directive.  For this case, the environment attribute
\fBtodo_all_todos\fP is used (again, the name should be unique, so it is prefixed
by the extension name).  It does not exist when a new environment is created, so
the directive must check and create it if necessary.  Various information about
the todo entry\(aqs location are stored along with a copy of the node.
.sp
In the last line, the nodes that should be put into the doctree are returned:
the target node and the admonition node.
.sp
The node structure that the directive returns looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX

The event handlers
.sp
Event handlers are one of Sphinx\(aqs most powerful features, providing a way to
do hook into any part of the documentation process. There are many events
provided by Sphinx itself, as detailed in \fI\%the API guide\fP, and
we\(aqre going to use a subset of them here.
.sp
Let\(aqs look at the event handlers used in the above example.  First, the one for
the \fI\%env\-purge\-doc\fP event:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
def purge_todos(app, env, docname):
    if not hasattr(env, \(aqtodo_all_todos\(aq):
        return

    env.todo_all_todos = [todo for todo in env.todo_all_todos if todo[\(aqdocname\(aq] != docname]


.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since we store information from source files in the environment, which is
persistent, it may become out of date when the source file changes.  Therefore,
before each source file is read, the environment\(aqs records of it are cleared,
and the \fI\%env\-purge\-doc\fP event gives extensions a chance to do the same.
Here we clear out all todos whose docname matches the given one from the
\fBtodo_all_todos\fP list.  If there are todos left in the document, they will be
added again during parsing.
.sp
The next handler, for the \fI\%env\-merge\-info\fP event, is used
during parallel builds. As during parallel builds all threads have
their own \fBenv\fP, there\(aqs multiple \fBtodo_all_todos\fP lists that need
to be merged:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
    if not hasattr(env, \(aqtodo_all_todos\(aq):
        env.todo_all_todos = []
    if hasattr(other, \(aqtodo_all_todos\(aq):
        env.todo_all_todos.extend(other.todo_all_todos)


.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The other handler belongs to the \fI\%doctree\-resolved\fP event:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
    if not app.config.todo_include_todos:
        for node in doctree.findall(todo):
            node.parent.remove(node)

    # Replace all todolist nodes with a list of the collected todos.
    # Augment each todo with a backlink to the original location.
    env = app.builder.env

    if not hasattr(env, \(aqtodo_all_todos\(aq):
        env.todo_all_todos = []

    for node in doctree.findall(todolist):
        if not app.config.todo_include_todos:
            node.replace_self([])
            continue

        content = []

        for todo_info in env.todo_all_todos:
            para = nodes.paragraph()
            filename = env.doc2path(todo_info[\(aqdocname\(aq], base=None)
            description = _(
                \(aq(The original entry is located in %s, line %d and can be found \(aq
            ) % (filename, todo_info[\(aqlineno\(aq])
            para += nodes.Text(description)

            # Create a reference
            newnode = nodes.reference(\(aq\(aq, \(aq\(aq)
            innernode = nodes.emphasis(_(\(aqhere\(aq), _(\(aqhere\(aq))
            newnode[\(aqrefdocname\(aq] = todo_info[\(aqdocname\(aq]
            newnode[\(aqrefuri\(aq] = app.builder.get_relative_uri(fromdocname, todo_info[\(aqdocname\(aq])
            newnode[\(aqrefuri\(aq] += \(aq#\(aq + todo_info[\(aqtarget\(aq][\(aqrefid\(aq]
            newnode.append(innernode)
            para += newnode
            para += nodes.Text(\(aq.)\(aq)

            # Insert into the todolist
            content.extend((
                todo_info[\(aqtodo\(aq],
                para,
            ))

        node.replace_self(content)

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%doctree\-resolved\fP event is emitted at the end of \fI\%phase 3
(resolving)\fP and allows custom resolving to be done. The handler
we have written for this event is a bit more involved. If the
\fBtodo_include_todos\fP config value (which we\(aqll describe shortly) is false,
all \fBtodo\fP and \fBtodolist\fP nodes are removed from the documents. If not,
\fBtodo\fP nodes just stay where and how they are.  \fBtodolist\fP nodes are
replaced by a list of todo entries, complete with backlinks to the location
where they come from.  The list items are composed of the nodes from the
\fBtodo\fP entry and docutils nodes created on the fly: a paragraph for each
entry, containing text that gives the location, and a link (reference node
containing an italic node) with the backreference. The reference URI is built
by \fI\%sphinx.builders.Builder.get_relative_uri()\fP which creates a suitable
URI depending on the used builder, and appending the todo node\(aqs (the target\(aqs)
ID as the anchor name.
.sp
The \fBsetup\fP function
.sp
As noted \fI\%previously\fP,
the \fBsetup\fP function is a requirement
and is used to plug directives into Sphinx. However, we also use it to hook up
the other parts of our extension. Let\(aqs look at our \fBsetup\fP function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
def setup(app: Sphinx) \-> ExtensionMetadata:
    app.add_config_value(\(aqtodo_include_todos\(aq, False, \(aqhtml\(aq)

    app.add_node(todolist)
    app.add_node(
        todo,
        html=(visit_todo_node, depart_todo_node),
        latex=(visit_todo_node, depart_todo_node),
        text=(visit_todo_node, depart_todo_node),
    )

    app.add_directive(\(aqtodo\(aq, TodoDirective)
    app.add_directive(\(aqtodolist\(aq, TodolistDirective)
    app.connect(\(aqdoctree\-resolved\(aq, process_todo_nodes)
    app.connect(\(aqenv\-purge\-doc\(aq, purge_todos)
    app.connect(\(aqenv\-merge\-info\(aq, merge_todos)

    return {
        \(aqversion\(aq: \(aq0.1\(aq,
        \(aqenv_version\(aq: 1,
        \(aqparallel_read_safe\(aq: True,
        \(aqparallel_write_safe\(aq: True,
    }

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The calls in this function refer to the classes and functions we added earlier.
What the individual calls do is the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%add_config_value()\fP lets Sphinx know that it should recognize the
new \fIconfig value\fP \fBtodo_include_todos\fP, whose default value should be
\fBFalse\fP (this also tells Sphinx that it is a boolean value).
.sp
If the third argument was \fB\(aqhtml\(aq\fP, HTML documents would be full rebuild if the
config value changed its value.  This is needed for config values that
influence reading (build \fI\%phase 1 (reading)\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%add_node()\fP adds a new \fInode class\fP to the build system.  It also
can specify visitor functions for each supported output format.  These visitor
functions are needed when the new nodes stay until \fI\%phase 4 (writing)\fP\&. Since the \fBtodolist\fP node is always replaced in
\fI\%phase 3 (resolving)\fP, it doesn\(aqt need any.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%add_directive()\fP adds a new \fIdirective\fP, given by name and class.
.IP \(bu 2
Finally, \fI\%connect()\fP adds an \fIevent handler\fP to the event whose
name is given by the first argument.  The event handler function is called
with several arguments which are documented with the event.
.UNINDENT
.sp
With this, our extension is complete.
.SS Using the extension
.sp
As before, we need to enable the extension by declaring it in our
\fBconf.py\fP file. There are two steps necessary here:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Add the \fB_ext\fP directory to the \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH'\fI\%Python path\fP\X'tty: link' using
\fBsys.path.append\fP\&. This should be placed at the top of the file.
.IP 2. 3
Update or create the \fI\%extensions\fP list and add the extension file
name to the list
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, we may wish to set the \fBtodo_include_todos\fP config value. As
noted above, this defaults to \fBFalse\fP but we can set it explicitly.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
import os
import sys

sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(\(dq./_ext\(dq))

extensions = [\(aqtodo\(aq]

todo_include_todos = False
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can now use the extension throughout your project. For example:
.sp
index.rst
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Hello, world
============

\&.. toctree::
   somefile.rst
   someotherfile.rst

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Because we have configured \fBtodo_include_todos\fP to \fBFalse\fP, we won\(aqt
actually see anything rendered for the \fBtodo\fP and \fBtodolist\fP directives.
However, if we toggle this to true, we will see the output described
previously.

.SS Adding a reference domain
.sp
The objective of this tutorial is to illustrate roles, directives and domains.
Once complete, we will be able to use this extension to describe a recipe and
reference that recipe from elsewhere in our documentation.
.sp

.SS Overview
.sp
We want the extension to add the following to Sphinx:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBrecipe\fP \fI\%directive\fP, containing some content describing the recipe
steps, along with a \fB:contains:\fP option highlighting the main ingredients
of the recipe.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBref\fP \fI\%role\fP, which provides a cross\-reference to the recipe
itself.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBrecipe\fP \fI\%domain\fP, which allows us to tie together the above role
and domain, along with things like indices.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For that, we will need to add the following elements to Sphinx:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A new directive called \fBrecipe\fP
.IP \(bu 2
New indexes to allow us to reference ingredient and recipes
.IP \(bu 2
A new domain called \fBrecipe\fP, which will contain the \fBrecipe\fP directive
and \fBref\fP role
.UNINDENT
.SS Prerequisites
.sp
We need the same setup as in
\fI\%the previous extensions\fP\&.
This time,
we will be putting out extension in a file called \fBrecipe.py\fP\&.

Let\(aqs look at each piece of this extension step\-by\-step to explain what\(aqs going
on.
.sp
The directive class
.sp
The first thing to examine is the \fBRecipeDirective\fP directive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
class RecipeDirective(ObjectDescription):
    \(dq\(dq\(dqA custom directive that describes a recipe.\(dq\(dq\(dq

    has_content = True

Unlike \fI\%Extending syntax with roles and directives\fP and \fI\%Extending the build process\fP,
this directive doesn\(aqt derive from
\fI\%docutils.parsers.rst.Directive\fP and doesn\(aqt define a \fBrun\fP method.
Instead, it derives from \fI\%sphinx.directives.ObjectDescription\fP and
defines  \fBhandle_signature\fP and \fBadd_target_and_index\fP methods. This is
because \fBObjectDescription\fP is a special\-purpose directive that\(aqs intended
for describing things like classes, functions, or, in our case, recipes. More
specifically, \fBhandle_signature\fP implements parsing the signature of the
directive and passes on the object\(aqs name and type to its superclass, while
\fBadd_target_and_index\fP adds a target (to link to) and an entry to the index
for this node.
.sp
We also see that this directive defines \fBhas_content\fP, \fBrequired_arguments\fP
and \fBoption_spec\fP\&. Unlike the \fBTodoDirective\fP directive added in the
\fI\%previous tutorial\fP,
this directive takes a single argument,
the recipe name, and an option, \fBcontains\fP,
in addition to the nested reStructuredText in the body.

Both \fBIngredientIndex\fP and \fBRecipeIndex\fP are derived from \fI\%Index\fP\&.
They implement custom logic to generate a tuple of values that define the
index. Note that \fBRecipeIndex\fP is a simple index that has only one entry.
Extending it to cover more object types is not yet part of the code.
.sp
Both indices use the method \fI\%Index.generate()\fP to do their work. This
method combines the information from our domain, sorts it, and returns it in a
list structure that will be accepted by Sphinx. This might look complicated but
all it really is is a list of tuples like \fB(\(aqtomato\(aq, \(aqTomatoSoup\(aq, \(aqtest\(aq,
\(aqrec\-TomatoSoup\(aq,...)\fP\&. Refer to the \fI\%domain API guide\fP for more information on this API.
.sp
These index pages can be referenced with the \fI\%ref\fP role by combining
the domain name and the index \fBname\fP value. For example, \fBRecipeIndex\fP can be
referenced with \fB:ref:\(garecipe\-recipe\(ga\fP and \fBIngredientIndex\fP can be referenced
with \fB:ref:\(garecipe\-ingredient\(ga\fP\&.

.sp
There are some interesting things to note about this \fBrecipe\fP domain and domains
in general. Firstly, we actually register our directives, roles and indices
here, via the \fBdirectives\fP, \fBroles\fP and \fBindices\fP attributes, rather than
via calls later on in \fBsetup\fP\&. We can also note that we aren\(aqt actually
defining a custom role and are instead reusing the
\fBsphinx.roles.XRefRole\fP role and defining the
\fI\%sphinx.domains.Domain.resolve_xref\fP method. This method takes two
arguments, \fBtyp\fP and \fBtarget\fP, which refer to the cross\-reference type and
its target name. We\(aqll use \fBtarget\fP to resolve our destination from our
domain\(aqs \fBrecipes\fP because we currently have only one type of node.
.sp
Moving on, we can see that we\(aqve defined \fBinitial_data\fP\&. The values defined in
\fBinitial_data\fP will be copied to \fBenv.domaindata[domain_name]\fP as the
initial data of the domain, and domain instances can access it via
\fBself.data\fP\&. We see that we have defined two items in \fBinitial_data\fP:
\fBrecipes\fP and \fBrecipe_ingredients\fP\&. Each contains a list of all objects
defined (i.e. all recipes) and a hash that maps a canonical ingredient name to
the list of objects. The way we name objects is common across our extension and
is defined in the \fBget_full_qualified_name\fP method. For each object created,
the canonical name is \fBrecipe.<recipename>\fP, where \fB<recipename>\fP is the
name the documentation writer gives the object (a recipe). This enables the
extension to use different object types that share the same name. Having a
canonical name and central place for our objects is a huge advantage. Both our
indices and our cross\-referencing code use this feature.
.sp
The \fBsetup\fP function
.sp
\fI\%As always\fP,
the \fBsetup\fP function is a requirement and is used to
hook the various parts of our extension into Sphinx. Let\(aqs look at the
\fBsetup\fP function for this extension.

        \(aqparallel_write_safe\(aq: True,
    }

.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This looks a little different to what we\(aqre used to seeing. There are no calls
to \fI\%add_directive()\fP or even \fI\%add_role()\fP\&. Instead, we
have a single call to \fI\%add_domain()\fP followed by some
initialization of the \fI\%standard domain\fP\&.
This is because we had already registered our directives,
roles and indexes as part of the directive itself.

.SS Developing autodoc extensions
.sp
The objective of this tutorial is to create an extension that adds
support for new type for autodoc. This autodoc extension will format
the \fBIntEnum\fP class from Python standard library. (module \fBenum\fP)
.SS Overview
.sp
We want the extension that will create auto\-documentation for IntEnum.
\fBIntEnum\fP is the integer enum class from standard library \fBenum\fP module.
.sp
Currently this class has no special auto documentation behavior.
.sp
We want to add following to autodoc:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fBautointenum\fP directive that will document the \fBIntEnum\fP class.
.IP \(bu 2
The generated documentation will have all the enum possible values
with names.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBautointenum\fP directive will have an option \fB:hex:\fP which will
cause the integers be printed in hexadecimal form.
.UNINDENT
.SS Prerequisites
.sp
We need the same setup as in
\fI\%the previous extensions\fP\&.
This time, we will be putting out extension
in a file called \fBautodoc_intenum.py\fP\&.
The \fBmy_enums.py\fP will contain the sample enums we will document.

\fBobjtype\fP
This attribute determines the \fBauto\fP directive name. In

.TP
\fBdirectivetype\fP
This attribute sets the generated directive name. In
this example the generated directive will be \fB\&.. :py:class::\fP\&.
.TP
\fBpriority\fP
the larger the number the higher is the priority. We want our
documenter be higher priority than the parent.
.TP
\fBoption_spec\fP
option specifications. We copy the parent class options and
add a new option \fIhex\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Overridden members:

.TP
\fBcan_document_member\fP
This member is important to override. It should
return \fITrue\fP when the passed object can be documented by this class.
.TP
\fBadd_directive_header\fP
This method generates the directive header. We add
\fB:final:\fP directive option. Remember to call \fBsuper\fP or no directive

\fBadd_content\fP
This method generates the body of the class documentation.
After calling the super method we generate lines for enum description.

.SS How\-tos
.SS Depend on another extension
.sp
Sometimes your extension depends on the functionality of another
Sphinx extension. Most Sphinx extensions are activated in a
project\(aqs \fBconf.py\fP file, but this is not available to you as an
extension developer.
.sp
To ensure that another extension is activated as a part of your own extension,
use the \fI\%sphinx.application.Sphinx.setup_extension()\fP method. This will
activate another extension at run\-time, ensuring that you have access to its
functionality.
.sp
For example, the following code activates the \fI\%sphinx.ext.autodoc\fP extension:

.sp
Added in version 1.6.

.sp
\fI\%builder\fP extensions can be discovered by means of \X'tty: link https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html'\fI\%entry points\fP\X'tty: link' so
that they do not have to be listed in the \fI\%extensions\fP configuration

.sp
Builder extensions should define an entry point in the \fB\(dqsphinx.builders\(dq\fP
group. The name of the entry point needs to match your builder\(aqs
\fI\%name\fP attribute, which is the name passed to the
\fI\%sphinx\-build \-b\fP option. The entry point value should equal the
dotted name of the extension module. Here is an example of how an entry point

Sphinx supports changing the appearance of its HTML output via \fIthemes\fP\&.  A
theme is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheet(s) and other static files.
Additionally, it has a configuration file which specifies from which theme to

.SS Templating

Sphinx uses the \X'tty: link https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/'\fI\%Jinja\fP\X'tty: link' templating engine
for its HTML templates.  Jinja is a text\-based engine, inspired by Django
templates, so anyone having used Django will already be familiar with it. It
also has excellent documentation for those who need to make themselves familiar
with it.

.SS Jinja/Sphinx Templating Primer
.sp
The default templating language in Sphinx is Jinja.  It\(aqs Django/Smarty inspired
and easy to understand.  The most important concept in Jinja is \fItemplate
inheritance\fP, which means that you can overwrite only specific blocks within a
template, customizing it while also keeping the changes at a minimum.
.sp
To customize the output of your documentation you can override all the templates
(both the layout templates and the child templates) by adding files with the
same name as the original filename into the template directory of the structure
the Sphinx quickstart generated for you.
.sp
Sphinx will look for templates in the folders of \fI\%templates_path\fP
first, and if it can\(aqt find the template it\(aqs looking for there, it falls back
to the selected theme\(aqs templates.
.sp
A template contains \fBvariables\fP, which are replaced with values when the
template is evaluated, \fBtags\fP, which control the logic of the template and
\fBblocks\fP which are used for template inheritance.
.sp
Sphinx\(aqs \fIbasic\fP theme provides base templates with a couple of blocks it will
fill with data.  These are located in the \fBthemes/basic\fP subdirectory of
the Sphinx installation directory, and used by all builtin Sphinx themes.
Templates with the same name in the \fI\%templates_path\fP override templates
supplied by the selected theme.
.sp
For example, to add a new link to the template area containing related links all
you have to do is to add a new template called \fBlayout.html\fP with the
following contents:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
{% extends \(dq!layout.html\(dq %}
{% block rootrellink %}
    <li><a href=\(dqhttps://project.invalid/\(dq>Project Homepage</a> &raquo;</li>
    {{ super() }}
{% endblock %}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By prefixing the name of the overridden template with an exclamation mark,
Sphinx will load the layout template from the underlying HTML theme.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you override a block, call \fB{{ super() }}\fP somewhere to render the

that content to show up.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Working with the builtin templates
.sp
The builtin \fBbasic\fP theme supplies the templates that all builtin Sphinx
themes are based on.  It has the following elements you can override or use:
.SS Blocks
.sp
The following blocks exist in the \fBlayout.html\fP template:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdoctype\fP
The doctype of the output format.  By default this is XHTML 1.0 Transitional
as this is the closest to what Sphinx and Docutils generate and it\(aqs a good
idea not to change it unless you want to switch to HTML 5 or a different but
compatible XHTML doctype.
.TP
.B \fBlinktags\fP
This block adds a couple of \fB<link>\fP tags to the head section of the
template.
.TP
.B \fBextrahead\fP
This block is empty by default and can be used to add extra contents into
the \fB<head>\fP tag of the generated HTML file.  This is the right place to
add references to JavaScript or extra CSS files.
.TP
.B \fBrelbar1\fP, \fBrelbar2\fP
This block contains the \fIrelation bar\fP, the list of related links (the
parent documents on the left, and the links to index, modules etc. on the
right).  \fBrelbar1\fP appears before the document, \fBrelbar2\fP after the
document.  By default, both blocks are filled; to show the relbar only
before the document, you would override \fBrelbar2\fP like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
{% block relbar2 %}{% endblock %}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBrootrellink\fP, \fBrelbaritems\fP
Inside the relbar there are three sections: The \fBrootrellink\fP, the links
from the documentation and the custom \fBrelbaritems\fP\&.  The \fBrootrellink\fP
is a block that by default contains a list item pointing to the root
document by default, the \fBrelbaritems\fP is an empty block.  If you
override them to add extra links into the bar make sure that they are list
items and end with the \fI\%reldelim1\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdocument\fP
The contents of the document itself.  It contains the block \(dqbody\(dq where
the individual content is put by subtemplates like \fBpage.html\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
In order for the built\-in JavaScript search to show a page preview on
the results page, the document or body content should be wrapped in an
HTML element containing the \fBrole=\(dqmain\(dq\fP attribute. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
<div role=\(dqmain\(dq>
  {% block document %}{% endblock %}
</div>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBsidebar1\fP, \fBsidebar2\fP
A possible location for a sidebar.  \fBsidebar1\fP appears before the document
and is empty by default, \fBsidebar2\fP after the document and contains the
default sidebar.  If you want to swap the sidebar location override this and
call the \fBsidebar\fP helper:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
{% block sidebar1 %}{{ sidebar() }}{% endblock %}
{% block sidebar2 %}{% endblock %}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(The \fBsidebar2\fP location for the sidebar is needed by the \fBsphinxdoc.css\fP
stylesheet, for example.)
.TP
.B \fBsidebarlogo\fP
The logo location within the sidebar.  Override this if you want to place
some content at the top of the sidebar.
.TP
.B \fBfooter\fP
The block for the footer div.  If you want a custom footer or markup before
or after it, override this one.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following four blocks are \fIonly\fP used for pages that do not have assigned a
list of custom sidebars in the \fI\%html_sidebars\fP config value.  Their use
is deprecated in favor of separate sidebar templates, which can be included via
\fI\%html_sidebars\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBsidebartoc\fP
The table of contents within the sidebar.
.sp
Deprecated since version 1.0.

.TP
.B \fBsidebarrel\fP
The relation links (previous, next document) within the sidebar.
.sp
Deprecated since version 1.0.

.TP
.B \fBsidebarsourcelink\fP
The \(dqShow source\(dq link within the sidebar (normally only shown if this is
enabled by \fI\%html_show_sourcelink\fP).
.sp
Deprecated since version 1.0.

.TP
.B \fBsidebarsearch\fP
The search box within the sidebar.  Override this if you want to place some
content at the bottom of the sidebar.
.sp
Deprecated since version 1.0.

.UNINDENT
.SS Configuration Variables
.sp
Inside templates you can set a couple of variables used by the layout template
using the \fB{% set %}\fP tag:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B reldelim1
The delimiter for the items on the left side of the related bar.  This
defaults to \fB\(aq &raquo;\(aq\fP Each item in the related bar ends with the value

syntax as \fI\%described in the templating document\fP\&.
.SS Static templates
.sp
Since theme options are meant for the user to configure a theme more easily,
without having to write a custom stylesheet, it is necessary to be able to
template static files as well as HTML files.  Therefore, Sphinx supports
so\-called \(dqstatic templates\(dq, like this:
.sp
If the name of a file in the \fBstatic/\fP directory of a theme (or in the user\(aqs
static path) ends with \fB\&.jinja\fP or \fB_t\fP, it will be processed by the
template engine.  The suffix will be removed from the final file name.
.sp
For example, a theme with a \fBstatic/theme_styles.css.jinja\fP file could use
templating to put options into the stylesheet.
When a documentation project is built with that theme,
the output directory will contain a \fB_static/theme_styles.css\fP file
where all template tags have been processed.
.sp
Changed in version 7.4: 
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The preferred suffix for static templates is now \fB\&.jinja\fP, in line with
the Jinja project\(aqs \X'tty: link https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/templates/#template-file-extension'\fI\%recommended file extension\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.sp
The \fB_t\fP file suffix for static templates is now considered \(aqlegacy\(aq, and
support may eventually be removed.
.sp
If a static template with either a \fB_t\fP suffix or a \fB\&.jinja\fP suffix is
detected, it will be processed by the template engine, with the suffix
removed from the final file name.

.SS Use custom page metadata in HTML templates
.sp
Any key / value pairs in \fI\%field lists\fP
that are placed \fIbefore\fP the page\(aqs title will be available to the Jinja
template when building the page within the \fI\%meta\fP attribute. For example,
if a page had the following text before its first title:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
:mykey: My value

My first title
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then it could be accessed within a Jinja template like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
{%\- if meta is mapping %}
    {{ meta.get(\(dqmykey\(dq) }}
{%\- endif %}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note the check that \fBmeta\fP is a dictionary (\(dqmapping\(dq in Jinja
terminology) to ensure that using it in this way is valid.
.SS Defining custom template functions
.sp
Sometimes it is useful to define your own function in Python that you wish to
then use in a template. For example, if you\(aqd like to insert a template value
with logic that depends on the user\(aqs configuration in the project, or if you\(aqd
like to include non\-trivial checks and provide friendly error messages for
incorrect configuration in the template.
.sp
To define your own template function, you\(aqll need to define two functions
inside your module:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBpage context event handler\fP (or \fBregistration\fP) function. This is
connected to the \fI\%Sphinx\fP application via an event callback.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBtemplate function\fP that you will use in your Jinja template.
.UNINDENT
.sp
First, define the registration function, which accepts the arguments for
\fI\%html\-page\-context\fP\&.
.sp
Within the registration function, define the template function that you\(aqd like to
use within Jinja. The template function should return a string or Python objects
(lists, dictionaries) with strings inside that Jinja uses in the templating process
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The template function will have access to all of the variables that
are passed to the registration function.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
At the end of the registration function, add the template function to the
Sphinx application\(aqs context with \fBcontext[\(aqtemplate_func\(aq] = template_func\fP\&.
.sp
Finally, in your extension\(aqs \fBsetup()\fP function, add your registration
function as a callback for \fI\%html\-page\-context\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# The registration function
 def setup_my_func(app, pagename, templatename, context, doctree):
     # The template function
     def my_func(mystring):
         return \(dqYour string is %s\(dq % mystring
     # Add it to the page\(aqs context
     context[\(aqmy_func\(aq] = my_func

 # Your extension\(aqs setup function
 def setup(app):
     app.connect(\(dqhtml\-page\-context\(dq, setup_my_func)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, you will have access to this function in jinja like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
<div>
{{ my_func(\(dqsome string\(dq) }}
</div>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Add your own static files to the build assets
.sp
By default, Sphinx copies static files on the \fBstatic/\fP directory of the template
directory.  However, if your package needs to place static files outside of the
\fBstatic/\fP directory for some reasons, you need to copy them to the \fB_static/\fP
directory of HTML outputs manually at the build via an event hook.  Here is an
example of code to accomplish this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
from os import path
from sphinx.util.fileutil import copy_asset_file

def copy_custom_files(app, exc):
    if app.builder.format == \(aqhtml\(aq and not exc:
        staticdir = path.join(app.builder.outdir, \(aq_static\(aq)
        copy_asset_file(\(aqpath/to/myextension/_static/myjsfile.js\(aq, staticdir)

def setup(app):
    app.connect(\(aqbuild\-finished\(aq, copy_custom_files)
.EE

.UNINDENT
.SS Inject JavaScript based on user configuration
.sp
If your extension makes use of JavaScript, it can be useful to allow users
to control its behavior using their Sphinx configuration. However, this can
be difficult to do if your JavaScript comes in the form of a static library
(which will not be built with Jinja).
.sp
There are two ways to inject variables into the JavaScript space based on user
configuration.
.sp
First, you may append \fB_t\fP to the end of any static files included with your
extension. This will cause Sphinx to process these files with the templating
engine, allowing you to embed variables and control behavior.
.sp
For example, the following JavaScript structure:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
mymodule/
├── _static
│\ \  └── myjsfile.js_t
└── mymodule.py
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Will result in the following static file placed in your HTML\(aqs build output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
_build/
└── html
    └── _static
 \ \      └── myjsfile.js
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
See \fI\%Static templates\fP for more information.
.sp
Second, you may use the \fI\%Sphinx.add_js_file()\fP method without pointing it
to a file. Normally, this method is used to insert a new JavaScript file
into your site. However, if you do \fInot\fP pass a file path, but instead pass
a string to the \(dqbody\(dq argument, then this text will be inserted as JavaScript
into your site\(aqs head. This allows you to insert variables into your project\(aqs
JavaScript from Python.
.sp
For example, the following code will read in a user\-configured value and then
insert this value as a JavaScript variable, which your extension\(aqs JavaScript
code may use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# This function reads in a variable and inserts it into JavaScript
def add_js_variable(app):
    # This is a configuration that you\(aqve specified for users in \(gaconf.py\(ga
    js_variable = app.config[\(aqmy_javascript_variable\(aq]
    js_text = \(dqvar my_variable = \(aq%s\(aq;\(dq % js_variable
    app.add_js_file(None, body=js_text)
# We connect this function to the step after the builder is initialized
def setup(app):
    # Tell Sphinx about this configuration variable
    app.add_config_value(\(aqmy_javascript_variable\(aq, 0, \(aqhtml\(aq)
    # Run the function after the builder is initialized
    app.connect(\(aqbuilder\-inited\(aq, add_js_variable)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As a result, in your theme you can use code that depends on the presence of
this variable. Users can control the variable\(aqs value by defining it in their
\fBconf.py\fP file.
.IP [1] 5
It is not an executable Python file, as opposed to \fBconf.py\fP,
because that would pose an unnecessary security risk if themes are
shared.
.SS Sphinx API
.sp
Since many projects will need special features in their documentation, Sphinx
is designed to be extensible on several levels.
.sp
Here are a few things you can do in an extension:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Add new \fI\%builder\fPs to support new output formats or actions on the
parsed documents.
.IP \(bu 2
Register custom reStructuredText roles and directives, extending the markup
using the \fI\%Docutils markup API\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Add custom code to so\-called \(dqhook points\(dq at strategic places throughout the
build process, allowing you to register a hook and run specialized code.
For example, see the \fI\%Event callbacks API\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
An extension is simply a Python module with a \fBsetup()\fP function. A user
activates the extension by placing the extension\(aqs module name
(or a sub\-module) in their \fI\%extensions\fP configuration value.
.sp
When \fBsphinx\-build\fP is executed, Sphinx will attempt to import each
module that is listed, and execute \fByourmodule.setup(app)\fP\&. This
function is used to prepare the extension (e.g., by executing Python code),
linking resources that Sphinx uses in the build process (like CSS or HTML
files), and notifying Sphinx of everything the extension offers (such
as directive or role definitions). The \fBapp\fP argument is an instance of
\fI\%Sphinx\fP and gives you control over most aspects of the Sphinx build.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The configuration file itself can be treated as an extension if it
contains a \fBsetup()\fP function.  All other extensions to load must be
listed in the \fI\%extensions\fP configuration value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The rest of this page describes some high\-level aspects of developing
extensions and various parts of Sphinx\(aqs behavior that you can control.
For some examples of how extensions can be built and used to control different
parts of Sphinx, see the \fI\%Tutorials\fP\&.
.SS Important objects
.sp
There are several key objects whose API you will use while writing an
extension. These are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBApplication\fP
The application object (usually called \fBapp\fP) is an instance of
\fI\%Sphinx\fP\&.  It controls most high\-level functionality, such as the
setup of extensions, event dispatching and producing output (logging).
.sp
If you have the environment object, the application is available as
\fBenv.app\fP\&.
.TP
\fBEnvironment\fP
The build environment object (usually called \fBenv\fP) is an instance of
\fI\%BuildEnvironment\fP\&.  It is responsible for parsing the source
documents, stores all metadata about the document collection and is
serialized to disk after each build.
.sp
Its API provides methods to do with access to metadata, resolving references,
etc.  It can also be used by extensions to cache information that should
persist for incremental rebuilds.
.sp
If you have the application or builder object, the environment is available
as \fBapp.env\fP or \fBbuilder.env\fP\&.
.TP
\fBBuilder\fP
The builder object (usually called \fBbuilder\fP) is an instance of a specific
subclass of \fI\%Builder\fP\&.  Each builder class knows how to convert the
parsed documents into an output format, or otherwise process them (e.g. check
external links).
.sp
If you have the application object, the builder is available as
\fBapp.builder\fP\&.
.TP
\fBConfig\fP
The config object (usually called \fBconfig\fP) provides the values of
configuration values set in \fBconf.py\fP as attributes.  It is an instance
of \fI\%Config\fP\&.
.sp
The config is available as \fBapp.config\fP or \fBenv.config\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To see an example of use of these objects, refer to
\fI\%the tutorials\fP\&.
.SS Build Phases
.sp
One thing that is vital in order to understand extension mechanisms is the way
in which a Sphinx project is built: this works in several phases.
.sp
\fBPhase 0: Initialization\fP
.sp
In this phase, almost nothing of interest to us happens.  The source
directory is searched for source files, and extensions are initialized.
Should a stored build environment exist, it is loaded, otherwise a new one is
created.
.sp
\fBPhase 1: Reading\fP
.sp
In Phase 1, all source files (and on subsequent builds, those that are new or
changed) are read and parsed.  This is the phase where directives and roles
are encountered by docutils, and the corresponding code is executed.  The
output of this phase is a \fIdoctree\fP for each source file; that is a tree of
docutils nodes.  For document elements that aren\(aqt fully known until all
existing files are read, temporary nodes are created.
.sp
There are nodes provided by docutils, which are documented \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/doctree.html'\fI\%in the docutils
documentation\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
Additional nodes are provided by Sphinx and \fI\%documented here\fP\&.
.sp
During reading, the build environment is updated with all meta\- and cross
reference data of the read documents, such as labels, the names of headings,
described Python objects and index entries.  This will later be used to
replace the temporary nodes.
.sp
The parsed doctrees are stored on the disk, because it is not possible to
hold all of them in memory.
.sp
\fBPhase 2: Consistency checks\fP
.sp
Some checking is done to ensure no surprises in the built documents.
.sp
\fBPhase 3: Resolving\fP
.sp
Now that the metadata and cross\-reference data of all existing documents is
known, all temporary nodes are replaced by nodes that can be converted into
output using components called transforms.  For example, links are created
for object references that exist, and simple literal nodes are created for
those that don\(aqt.
.sp
\fBPhase 4: Writing\fP
.sp
This phase converts the resolved doctrees to the desired output format, such
as HTML or LaTeX.  This happens via a so\-called docutils writer that visits
the individual nodes of each doctree and produces some output in the process.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Some builders deviate from this general build plan, for example, the builder
that checks external links does not need anything more than the parsed
doctrees and therefore does not have phases 2\-\-4.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To see an example of application, refer to \fI\%Extending the build process\fP\&.
.SS Extension metadata
.sp
Added in version 1.3.

.sp
The \fBsetup()\fP function can return a dictionary.  This is treated by Sphinx
as metadata of the extension.  Metadata keys currently recognized are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\(aqversion\(aq\fP: a string that identifies the extension version.  It is used for
extension version requirement checking (see \fI\%needs_extensions\fP) and
informational purposes.  If not given, \fB\(dqunknown version\(dq\fP is substituted.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\(aqenv_version\(aq\fP: an integer that identifies the version of env data
structure if the extension stores any data to environment.  It is used to
detect the data structure has been changed from last build.  The extensions
have to increment the version when data structure has changed.  If not given,
Sphinx considers the extension does not stores any data to environment.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\(aqparallel_read_safe\(aq\fP: a boolean that specifies if parallel reading of
source files can be used when the extension is loaded.  It defaults to
\fBFalse\fP, i.e. you have to explicitly specify your extension to be
parallel\-read\-safe after checking that it is.
.sp

This is used to register a custom output translator or to replace a
builtin translator.  This allows extensions to use a custom translator
and define custom nodes for the translator (see \fI\%add_node()\fP).
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Parameters
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBname\fP \-\- The name of the builder for the translator
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtranslator_class\fP \-\- A translator class
.IP \(bu 2
\fBoverride\fP \-\- If true, install the translator forcedly even if another translator
is already installed as the same name

Node visitor functions for the Sphinx HTML, LaTeX, text and manpage
writers can be given as keyword arguments: the keyword should be one or
more of \fB\(aqhtml\(aq\fP, \fB\(aqlatex\(aq\fP, \fB\(aqtext\(aq\fP, \fB\(aqman\(aq\fP, \fB\(aqtexinfo\(aq\fP
or any other supported translators, the value a 2\-tuple of \fB(visit,
depart)\fP methods.  \fBdepart\fP can be \fBNone\fP if the \fBvisit\fP
function raises \fBdocutils.nodes.SkipNode\fP\&.  Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
class math(docutils.nodes.Element): pass

def visit_math_html(self, node):
    self.body.append(self.starttag(node, \(aqmath\(aq))

.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Parameters
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnode\fP \-\- A node class
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfigtype\fP \-\- The type of enumerable nodes.  Each figtype has individual numbering
sequences.  As system figtypes, \fBfigure\fP, \fBtable\fP and

these default figtypes.  It is also possible to define new custom
figtype if a new figtype is given.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtitle_getter\fP \-\- A getter function to obtain the title of node.  It takes an
instance of the enumerable node, and it must return its title as
string.  The title is used to the default title of references for
\fI\%ref\fP\&.  By default, Sphinx searches
\fBdocutils.nodes.caption\fP or \fBdocutils.nodes.title\fP from the
node as a title.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBkwargs\fP \-\- Visitor functions for each builder (same as \fI\%add_node()\fP)

Register a new object type.
.sp
This method is a very convenient way to add a new \fI\%object\fP type
that can be cross\-referenced.  It will do this:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Create a new directive (called \fIdirectivename\fP) for documenting an
object.  It will automatically add index entries if \fIindextemplate\fP
is nonempty; if given, it must contain exactly one instance of
\fB%s\fP\&.  See the example below for how the template will be
interpreted.
.IP \(bu 2
Create a new role (called \fIrolename\fP) to cross\-reference to these
object descriptions.
.IP \(bu 2
If you provide \fIparse_node\fP, it must be a function that takes a
string and a docutils node, and it must populate the node with
children parsed from the string.  It must then return the name of the
item to be used in cross\-referencing and index entries.  See the
\fBconf.py\fP file in the source for this documentation for an
example.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fIobjname\fP (if not given, will default to \fIdirectivename\fP) names
the type of object.  It is used when listing objects, e.g. in search
results.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, if you have this call in a custom Sphinx extension:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
app.add_object_type(\(aqdirective\(aq, \(aqdir\(aq, \(aqpair: %s; directive\(aq)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
you can use this markup in your documents:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

.EX
\&.. rst:directive:: function

   Document a function.

.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. index:: pair: function; directive
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The reference node will be of class \fBliteral\fP (so it will be rendered
in a proportional font, as appropriate for code) unless you give the
\fIref_nodeclass\fP argument, which must be a docutils node class.  Most
useful are \fBdocutils.nodes.emphasis\fP or \fBdocutils.nodes.strong\fP \-\-
you can also use \fBdocutils.nodes.generated\fP if you want no further
text decoration.  If the text should be treated as literal (e.g. no
smart quote replacement), but not have typewriter styling, use
\fBsphinx.addnodes.literal_emphasis\fP or
\fBsphinx.addnodes.literal_strong\fP\&.
.sp
For the role content, you have the same syntactical possibilities as
for standard Sphinx roles (see \fI\%Cross\-referencing syntax\fP).
.sp
If \fIoverride\fP is True, the given object_type is forcedly installed even if
an object_type having the same name is already installed.

This method is very similar to \fI\%add_object_type()\fP except that the

Connecting callback functions to events is a simple way to extend Sphinx,
by hooking into the build process at various points.
.sp
Use \fI\%Sphinx.connect()\fP in an extension\(aqs \fBsetup\fP function,
or a \fBsetup\fP function in your projects \fBconf.py\fP,
to connect functions to the events:

for docname in docnames:
   5. event.env\-purge\-doc(app, env, docname)

   if doc changed and not removed:
      6. source\-read(app, docname, source)
      7. run source parsers: text \-> docutils.document
         \- parsers can be added with the app.add_source_parser() API
      8. apply transforms based on priority: docutils.document \-> docutils.document
         \- event.doctree\-read(app, doctree) is called in the middle of transforms,
           transforms come before/after this event depending on their priority.

9. event.env\-merge\-info(app, env, docnames, other)
   \- if running in parallel mode, this event will be emitted for each process

10. event.env\-updated(app, env)
11. event.env\-get\-updated(app, env)
12. event.env\-check\-consistency(app, env)

# The updated\-docs list can be builder dependent, but generally includes all new/changed documents,
# plus any output from \(gaenv\-get\-updated\(ga, and then all \(dqparent\(dq documents in the ToC tree
# For builders that output a single page, they are first joined into a single doctree before post\-transforms
# or the doctree\-resolved event is emitted
for docname in updated\-docs:
   13. apply post\-transforms (by priority): docutils.document \-> docutils.document
   14. event.doctree\-resolved(app, doctree, docname)
       \- In the event that any reference nodes fail to resolve, the following may emit:
       \- event.missing\-reference(env, node, contnode)

This section describes the API for adding reStructuredText markup elements
(roles and directives).
.SS Roles
.sp

They have to be registered by an extension using

    elements = []
    messages = []
    return elements, messages
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fIoptions\fP and \fIcontent\fP parameters are only used for custom roles
created via the \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#role'\fI\%role\fP\X'tty: link' directive.
The return value is a tuple of two lists,
the first containing the text nodes and elements from the role,
and the second containing any system messages generated.
For more information, see the \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/howto/rst-roles.html'\fI\%custom role overview\fP\X'tty: link' from Docutils.
.SS Creating custom roles
.sp
Sphinx provides two base classes for creating custom roles,
\fI\%SphinxRole\fP and \fI\%ReferenceRole\fP\&.
.sp
These provide a class\-based interface for creating roles,
where the main logic must be implemented in your \fBrun()\fP method.
The classes provide a number of useful methods and attributes,
such as \fBself.text\fP, \fBself.config\fP, and \fBself.env\fP\&.
The \fBReferenceRole\fP class implements Sphinx\(aqs \fBtitle <target>\fP logic,
exposing \fBself.target\fP and \fBself.title\fP attributes.
This is useful for creating cross\-reference roles.
.SS Directives
.sp
Directives are handled by classes derived from
\fBdocutils.parsers.rst.Directive\fP\&.  They have to be registered by an extension
using \fI\%Sphinx.add_directive()\fP or \fI\%Sphinx.add_directive_to_domain()\fP\&.

.B option_spec = None
Mapping of option names to validator functions.
.sp
Option validator functions take a single parameter, the option argument
(or \fBNone\fP if not given), and should validate it or convert it to the
proper form.  They raise \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError'\fI\%ValueError\fP\X'tty: link' or \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError'\fI\%TypeError\fP\X'tty: link' to indicate

\fBdocutils.parsers.rst.directives\fP module.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B has_content = False
May the directive have content?
.UNINDENT
.sp
New directives must implement the \fI\%run()\fP method:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B run()
This method must process the directive arguments, options and content, and
return a list of Docutils/Sphinx nodes that will be inserted into the
document tree at the point where the directive was encountered.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Instance attributes that are always set on the directive are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B name
The directive name (useful when registering the same directive class under
multiple names).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B arguments
The arguments given to the directive, as a list.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B options
The options given to the directive, as a dictionary mapping option names
to validated/converted values.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B content
The directive content, if given, as a \fBViewList\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B lineno
The absolute line number on which the directive appeared.  This is not
always a useful value; use \fBsrcline\fP instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B content_offset
Internal offset of the directive content.  Used when calling
\fBnested_parse\fP (see below).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B block_text
The string containing the entire directive.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0

.B state
.TP
.B state_machine
The state and state machine which controls the parsing.  Used for
\fBnested_parse\fP\&.

.SS Parsing directive content as reStructuredText
.sp
Many directives will contain more markup that must be parsed.
To do this, use one of the following APIs from the \fI\%run()\fP method:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%SphinxDirective.parse_content_to_nodes()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%SphinxDirective.parse_text_to_nodes()\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first method parses all the directive\(aqs content as markup,
whilst the second only parses the given \fItext\fP string.
Both methods return the parsed Docutils nodes in a list.
.sp
The methods are used as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
def run(self) \-> list[Node]:
    # either
    parsed = self.parse_content_to_nodes()

    return parsed
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The above utility methods were added in Sphinx 7.4.
Prior to Sphinx 7.4, the following methods should be used to parse content:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBself.state.nested_parse\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsphinx.util.nodes.nested_parse_with_titles()\fP \-\- this allows titles in
the parsed content.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
def run(self) \-> list[Node]:
    container = docutils.nodes.Element()
    # either
    nested_parse_with_titles(self.state, self.result, container)
    # or
    self.state.nested_parse(self.result, 0, container)
    parsed = container.children
    return parsed
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To parse inline markup,
use \fI\%parse_inline()\fP\&.
This must only be used for text which is a single line or paragraph,
and does not contain any structural elements
(headings, transitions, directives, etc).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBsphinx.util.docutils.switch_source_input()\fP allows changing
the source (input) file during parsing content in a directive.
It is useful to parse mixed content, such as in \fBsphinx.ext.autodoc\fP,
where it is used to parse docstrings.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
from sphinx.util.docutils import switch_source_input
from sphinx.util.parsing import nested_parse_to_nodes

# Switch source_input between parsing content.

with switch_source_input(self.state, self.result):
    parsed = nested_parse_to_nodes(self.state, self.result)
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Deprecated since version 1.7: Until Sphinx 1.6, \fBsphinx.ext.autodoc.AutodocReporter\fP was used for this
purpose.  It is replaced by \fBswitch_source_input()\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ViewLists and StringLists
.sp
Docutils represents document source lines in a \fBStringList\fP class,
which inherits from \fBViewList\fP, both in the \fBdocutils.statemachine\fP module.
This is a list with extended functionality,
including that slicing creates views of the original list and
that the list contains information about source line numbers.
.sp
The \fI\%Directive.content\fP attribute is a \fBStringList\fP\&.
If you generate content to be parsed as reStructuredText,
you have to create a \fBStringList\fP for the Docutils APIs.
The utility functions provided by Sphinx handle this automatically.
Important for content generation are the following points:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBViewList\fP constructor takes a list of strings (lines)
and a source (document) name.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBViewList.append()\fP method takes a line and a source name as well.
.UNINDENT
.SS Domain API
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B class sphinx.domains.Domain(env: \fI\%BuildEnvironment\fP)
A Domain is meant to be a group of \(dqobject\(dq description directives for
objects of a similar nature, and corresponding roles to create references to
them.  Examples would be Python modules, classes, functions etc., elements
of a templating language, Sphinx roles and directives, etc.
.sp
Each domain has a separate storage for information about existing objects
and how to reference them in \fIself.data\fP, which must be a dictionary.  It
also must implement several functions that expose the object information in
a uniform way to parts of Sphinx that allow the user to reference or search
for objects in a domain\-agnostic way.
.sp
About \fIself.data\fP: since all object and cross\-referencing information is
stored on a BuildEnvironment instance, the \fIdomain.data\fP object is also
stored in the \fIenv.domaindata\fP dict under the key \fIdomain.name\fP\&.  Before the
build process starts, every active domain is instantiated and given the
environment object; the \fIdomaindata\fP dict must then either be nonexistent or
a dictionary whose \(aqversion\(aq key is equal to the domain class\(aq
\fI\%data_version\fP attribute.  Otherwise, \fIOSError\fP is raised and the
pickled environment is discarded.

Returns a tuple of strings, one entry for each part of the object\(aqs
hierarchy (e.g. \fB(\(aqmodule\(aq, \(aqsubmodule\(aq, \(aqClass\(aq, \(aqmethod\(aq)\fP). The
returned tuple is used to properly nest children within parents in the
table of contents, and can also be used within the

.B _toc_entry_name(sig_node: \fI\%desc_signature\fP) -> \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str'\fI\%str\fP\X'tty: link'
Returns the text of the table of contents entry for the object.
.sp
This function is called once, in \fI\%run()\fP, to set the name for the
table of contents entry (a special attribute \fB_toc_name\fP is set on the
object node, later used in
\fBenvironment.collectors.toctree.TocTreeCollector.process_doc().build_toc()\fP
when the table of contents entries are collected).
.sp
To support table of contents entries for their objects, domains must
override this method, also respecting the configuration setting
\fBtoc_object_entries_show_parents\fP\&. Domains must also override
\fI\%_object_hierarchy_parts()\fP, with one (string) entry for each part of the
object\(aqs hierarchy. The result of this method is set on the signature
node, and can be accessed as \fBsig_node[\(aq_toc_parts\(aq]\fP for use within
this method. The resulting tuple is also used to properly nest children
within parents in the table of contents.
.sp
An example implementations of this method is within the python domain
(\fBPyObject._toc_entry_name()\fP). The python domain sets the
\fB_toc_parts\fP attribute within the \fI\%handle_signature()\fP
method.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The Parser analyzes the input document and creates a node tree
representation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In Sphinx, the parser modules works as same as docutils.  The parsers are
registered to Sphinx by extensions using Application APIs;
\fI\%Sphinx.add_source_suffix()\fP and \fI\%Sphinx.add_source_parser()\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIsource suffix\fP is a mapping from file suffix to file type.  For example,
\fB\&.rst\fP file is mapped to \fB\(aqrestructuredtext\(aq\fP type.  Sphinx uses the
file type to looking for parsers from registered list.  On searching,
Sphinx refers to the \fBParser.supported\fP attribute and picks up a parser
which contains the file type in the attribute.
.sp
The users can override the source suffix mappings using
\fI\%source_suffix\fP like following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# a mapping from file suffix to file types

.B class sphinx.addnodes.pending_xref_condition(rawsource=\(aq\(aq, text=\(aq\(aq, *children, **attributes)
Node representing a potential way to create a cross\-reference and the
condition in which this way should be used.
.sp
This node is only allowed to be placed under a \fI\%pending_xref\fP
node.  A \fBpending_xref\fP node must contain either no \fBpending_xref_condition\fP
nodes or it must only contains \fBpending_xref_condition\fP nodes.
.sp
The cross\-reference resolver will replace a \fI\%pending_xref\fP which
contains \fBpending_xref_condition\fP nodes by the content of exactly one of
those \fBpending_xref_condition\fP nodes\(aq content. It uses the \fBcondition\fP
attribute to decide which \fBpending_xref_condition\fP node\(aqs content to
use. For example, let us consider how the cross\-reference resolver acts on:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
<pending_xref refdomain=\(dqpy\(dq reftarget=\(dqio.StringIO ...>
    <pending_xref_condition condition=\(dqresolved\(dq>
        <literal>
            StringIO
    <pending_xref_condition condition=\(dq*\(dq>
        <literal>
            io.StringIO
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the cross\-reference resolver successfully resolves the cross\-reference,
then it rewrites the \fBpending_xref\fP as:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
<reference>
    <literal>
        StringIO
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Otherwise, if the cross\-reference resolution failed, it rewrites the
\fBpending_xref\fP as:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
<reference>
    <literal>
        io.StringIO
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBpending_xref_condition\fP node should have \fBcondition\fP attribute.
Domains can be store their individual conditions into the attribute to
filter contents on resolving phase.  As a reserved condition name,
\fBcondition=\(dq*\(dq\fP is used for the fallback of resolution failure.
Additionally, as a recommended condition name, \fBcondition=\(dqresolved\(dq\fP
represents a resolution success in the intersphinx module.

.B class sphinx.transforms.post_transforms.images.ImageConverter(document, startnode=None)
A base class for image converters.
.sp
An image converter is kind of Docutils transform module.  It is used to
convert image files which are not supported by a builder to the
appropriate format for that builder.
.sp
For example, \fI\%LaTeX builder\fP supports PDF,
PNG and JPEG as image formats.  However it does not support SVG images.
For such case, using image converters allows to embed these
unsupported images into the document.  One of the image converters;
\fI\%sphinx.ext.imgconverter\fP can convert
a SVG image to PNG format using Imagemagick internally.
.sp
There are three steps to make your custom image converter:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
Make a subclass of \fBImageConverter\fP class
.IP 2. 3
Override \fBconversion_rules\fP, \fBis_available()\fP and \fBconvert()\fP
.IP 3. 3
Register your image converter to Sphinx using
\fI\%Sphinx.add_post_transform()\fP

.B Parameters
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstate\fP \-\- The state machine state. Must be a subclass of \fBRSTState\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtext\fP \-\- Text, in string form. \fBStringList\fP is also accepted.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsource\fP \-\- The text\(aqs source, used when creating a new \fBStringList\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBoffset\fP \-\- The offset of the content.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBallow_section_headings\fP \-\- Are titles (sections) allowed in \fItext\fP?
Note that this option bypasses Docutils\(aq usual checks on
doctree structure, and misuse of this option can lead to
an incoherent doctree. In Docutils, section nodes should
only be children of \fBStructural\fP nodes, which includes
\fBdocument\fP, \fBsection\fP, and \fBsidebar\fP nodes.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBkeep_title_context\fP \-\- If this is False (the default), then \fIcontent\fP is parsed as if it were
an independent document, meaning that title decorations (e.g. underlines)
do not need to match the surrounding document.
This is useful when the parsed content comes from
a completely different context, such as docstrings.
If this is True, then title underlines must match those in
the surrounding document, otherwise the behaviour is undefined.

On developing Sphinx, we are always careful to the compatibility of our APIs.
But, sometimes, the change of interface are needed for some reasons.  In such
cases, we\(aqve marked them as deprecated. And they are kept during the two
major versions (for more details, please see \fI\%Deprecation policy\fP).

A dictionary that contains LaTeX snippets overriding those Sphinx usually puts

inserted in generated files, via \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#raw'\fI\%raw\fP\X'tty: link' directives.  For example, in

If using \fButf8x\fP in place of \fButf8\fP it is mandatory to extend the
LaTeX preamble with suitable \fB\ePreloadUnicodePage{<number>}\fP commands,
as per the \fButf8x\fP documentation (\fBtexdoc ucs\fP on a TeXLive based
TeX installation).  Else, unexpected and possibly hard\-to\-spot problems
(i.e. not causing a build crash) may arise in the PDF, in particular
regarding hyperlinks.
.sp
Even if these precautions are taken, PDF build via \fBpdflatex\fP engine
may crash due to upstream LaTeX not being fully compatible with
\fButf8x\fP\&.  For example, in certain circumstances related to
code\-blocks, or attempting to include images whose filenames contain
Unicode characters.  Indeed, starting in 2015, upstream LaTeX with
\fBpdflatex\fP engine has somewhat enhanced native support for Unicode and
is becoming more and more incompatible with \fButf8x\fP\&.  In particular,
since the October 2019 LaTeX release, filenames can use Unicode
characters, and even spaces.  At Sphinx level this means e.g. that the
\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#image'\fI\%image\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#figure'\fI\%figure\fP\X'tty: link' directives are now compatible with
such filenames for PDF via LaTeX output.  But this is broken if
\fButf8x\fP is in use.

Prior to 5.1.0 there was no separate customizability of
padding for warning\-type boxes in PDF via LaTeX output.  The sum of
padding and border\-width (as set for example for \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#warning'\fI\%warning\fP\X'tty: link' by
\fBwarningborder\fP, now also named \fBdiv.warning_border\-width\fP) was
kept to a certain constant value.  This limited the border\-width
to small values else the border could overlap the text contents.
This behavior is kept as default.
.UNINDENT

the same padding behavior is obeyed per default for \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#note'\fI\%note\fP\X'tty: link' or

or two dimensions followed by the keyword \fBinset\fP\&.
.UNINDENT

The shadow color defaults in all cases to \fB{rgb}{0,0,0}\fP i.e. to black.

Since 6.0.0 the border color and background color of \fI\%code\-block\fP,
i.e. \fBpre\fP prefix, default respectively to \fB{RGB}{32,32,32}\fP and
\fB{gray}{0.95}\fP\&.  They previously defaulted to black, respectively white.
.sp
For all other types, the border color defaults to black and the background
color to white.
.sp
The \fB<prefix>_TeXcolor\fP stands for the CSS property \(dqcolor\(dq, i.e. it
influences the text color of the contents.  As for the three other options,
the naming \fBTeXcolor\fP is to stress that the input syntax is the TeX one
for colors not an HTML/CSS one.  If package \fBxcolor\fP is available in the
LaTeX installation, one can use directly named colors as key values.
Consider passing options such as \fBdvipsnames\fP, \fBsvgnames\fP or \fBx11names\fP
to \fBxcolor\fP via \fB\(aqpassoptionstopackages\(aq\fP key of \fI\%latex_elements\fP\&.
.sp
If \fB<prefix>_TeXcolor\fP is set, a \fB\ecolor\fP command is inserted at
start of the directive contents; for admonitions, this happens after the
heading which reproduces the admonition type.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<prefix>_TeXextras\fP: if set, its value must be some LaTeX command or
commands, for example \fB\eitshape\fP\&.  These commands will be inserted at the
start of the contents; for admonitions, this happens after the heading which
reproduces the admonition type.

The corners of rounded boxes may be elliptical.
.sp
Changed in version 6.2.0: Formerly, only circular rounded corners were supported and a rounded

Inset shadows are incompatible with rounded corners.  In case
both are specified the inset shadow will simply be ignored.

\fBpre_TeXcolor\fP will influence only the few non\-Pygments highlighted
tokens; it does color the line numbers, but if one wants to color
\fIonly\fP them one has to go through the \fBfancyvrb\fP interface.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpre_TeXextras=\efootnotesize\fP for example may be replaced by usage of
the \fI\%latex_elements\fP key \fB\(aqfvset\(aq\fP\&.  For \fB\(aqlualatex\(aq\fP or
\fB\(aqxelatex\(aq\fP Sphinx includes in the preamble already
\fB\efvset{fontsize=\esmall}\fP and this induces \fBfancyvrb\fP into
overriding a \fB\efootnotesize\fP coming from \fBpre_TeXextras\fP\&.  One has
to use \fBpre_TeXextras=\efvset{fontsize=\efootnotesize}\fP syntax.
Simpler to set directly the \fI\%latex_elements\fP key
\fB\(aqfvset\(aq\fP\&...
.UNINDENT
.sp
Consider these options experimental and that some implementation details
may change.  For example if the \fBpre_TeXextras\fP LaTeX commands were put
by Sphinx in another location it could override the \fB\(aqfvset\(aq\fP effect,
perhaps this is what will be done in a future release.
.IP \(bu 2
Rounded boxes are done using the \X'tty: link https://ctan.org/pkg/pict2e'\fI\%pict2e\fP\X'tty: link' interface to some basic PDF
graphics operations.  If this LaTeX package can not be found the build
will proceed and render all boxes with straight corners.
.IP \(bu 2
Elliptic corners use the \X'tty: link https://ctan.org/pkg/ellipse'\fI\%ellipse\fP\X'tty: link' LaTeX package which extends \X'tty: link https://ctan.org/pkg/pict2e'\fI\%pict2e\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
If this LaTeX package can not be found rounded corners will be circular
arcs (or straight if \X'tty: link https://ctan.org/pkg/pict2e'\fI\%pict2e\fP\X'tty: link' is not available).

For \fI\%code\-block\fP, padding and border\-width and shadow (if one adds
one) will go into the margin; the code lines remain at the same place
independently of the values of the padding and border\-width, except for
being shifted vertically of course to not overwrite other text due to the
width of the border or external shadow.
.IP \(bu 2
For \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#topic'\fI\%topic\fP\X'tty: link' (and \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table-of-contents'\fI\%contents\fP\X'tty: link') the shadow (if on right) goes into the
page margin, but the border and the extra padding are kept within the text
area.  Same for admonitions.

The \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#table-of-contents'\fI\%contents\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#topic'\fI\%topic\fP\X'tty: link' directives are governed by the same options
with \fBdiv.topic\fP prefix: the Sphinx LaTeX mark\-up uses for both directives
the same \fBsphinxShadowBox\fP environment which has currently no additional
branching, contrarily to the \fBsphinxadmonition\fP environment which branches
according to the admonition directive name, e.g. either to \fBsphinxnote\fP
or \fBsphinxwarning\fP etc...

.SS LaTeX macros and environments
.sp
The \(dqLaTeX package\(dq file \fBsphinx.sty\fP loads various components
providing support macros (aka commands), and environments, which are used in
the mark\-up produced on output from the \fBlatex\fP builder, before conversion
to \fBpdf\fP via the LaTeX toolchain.  Also the \(dqLaTeX class\(dq files
\fBsphinxhowto.cls\fP and \fBsphinxmanual.cls\fP define or customize some
environments.  All of these files can be found in the latex build repertory.
.sp
Some of these provide facilities not available from pre\-existing LaTeX
packages and work around LaTeX limitations with lists, table cells, verbatim
rendering, footnotes, etc...
.sp
Others simply define macros with public names to make overwriting their
defaults easy via user\-added contents to the preamble.  We will survey most of
those public names here, but defaults have to be looked at in their respective
definition files.

Rather than adding code to the preamble via

also possible to replace entirely one of the component files of Sphinx
LaTeX code with a custom version, simply by including a modified copy in

and \fBaddstrut\fP which is a boolean key, i.e. to be used as \fBaddstrut=true\fP,
or \fBaddstrut\fP alone where \fB=true\fP is omitted, or \fBaddstrut=false\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This last key is specific to \fB\esphinxbox\fP and it means to add a \fB\estrut\fP
so that heights and depths are equalized across various instances on the same
line with varying contents.  The default is \fBaddstrut=false\fP\&.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Perhaps the default will turn into \fBaddstrut=true\fP at 7.0.0 depending on
feedback until then.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The combination \fBaddstrut, padding\-bottom=0pt, padding\-top=1pt\fP is often
satisfactory.
.sp
Refer to \fI\%Additional  CSS\-like \(aqsphinxsetup\(aq keys\fP for important syntax information regarding the
other keys.  The default
configuration uses no shadow, a border\-width of \fB\efboxrule\fP, a padding of
\fB\efboxsep\fP, circular corners with radii \fB\efboxsep\fP and background and
border colors as for the default rendering of code\-blocks.
.sp
When a \fB\esphinxbox\fP usage is nested within another one, it will ignore the
options of the outer one: it first resets all options to their default state
as they were prior to applying the outer box options, then it applies its own
specific ones.
.sp
One can modify these defaults via the command \fB\esphinxboxsetup{key=value,...}\fP\&.
The effect is cumulative, if one uses this command multiple times.  Here the
options are a mandatory argument so are within curly braces, not square
brackets.
.sp
Here is some example of use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
latex_elements = {
    \(aqpreamble\(aq: r\(aq\(aq\(aq
% modify globally the defaults
\esphinxboxsetup{border\-width=2pt,%

A utility \fB\enewsphinxbox\fP is provided to create a new boxing macro, say
\fB\efoo\fP which will act exactly like \fB\esphinxbox\fP but with a given extra

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
% the specific options to \efoo are within brackets
\enewsphinxbox[border\-radius=0pt, box\-shadow=2pt 2pt]{\efoo}
% then use this \efoo, possibly with some extra options still:
\eprotected\edef\esphinxguilabel#1{\efoo{#1}}
\eprotected\edef\esphinxmenuselection#1{\efoo[box\-shadow\-TeXcolor=gray]{#1}}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Boxes rendered with \fB\efoo\fP obey as the ones using directly \fB\esphinxbox\fP
the current configuration as set possibly mid\-way in document via
\fB\esphinxboxsetup\fP (from a \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#raw'\fI\%raw\fP\X'tty: link' LaTeX mark\-up), the only difference
is that they have an initial additional set of default extras.

In the above examples, you can probably use \fB\erenewcommand\fP syntax if you
prefer it to \fB\eprotected\edef\fP (with \fB[1]\fP in place of \fB#1\fP then).

The Sphinx source code is managed using Git and is hosted on \X'tty: link https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx'\fI\%GitHub\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  The
recommended way for new contributors to submit code to Sphinx is to fork this
repository and submit a pull request after committing changes to their fork.
The pull request will then need to be approved by one of the core developers
before it is merged into the main repository.
.SS Getting started

.SS Translations
.sp
The parts of messages in Sphinx that go into builds are translated into several
locales.  The translations are kept as gettext \fB\&.po\fP files translated from the
master template \fBsphinx/locale/sphinx.pot\fP\&.
.sp
Sphinx uses \X'tty: link https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/'\fI\%Babel\fP\X'tty: link' to extract messages
and maintain the catalog files.  The \fButils\fP directory contains a helper
script, \fBbabel_runner.py\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use \fBpython babel_runner.py extract\fP to update the \fB\&.pot\fP template.
.IP \(bu 2
Use \fBpython babel_runner.py update\fP to update all existing language
catalogs in \fBsphinx/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES\fP with the current messages in the
template file.
.IP \(bu 2
Use \fBpython babel_runner.py compile\fP to compile the \fB\&.po\fP files to binary
\fB\&.mo\fP files and \fB\&.js\fP files.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When an updated \fB\&.po\fP file is submitted, run
\fBpython babel_runner.py compile\fP to commit both the source and the compiled
catalogs.
.sp
When a new locale is submitted, add a new directory with the ISO 639\-1 language
identifier and put \fBsphinx.po\fP in there.  Don\(aqt forget to update the possible
values for \fI\%language\fP in \fBdoc/usage/configuration.rst\fP\&.
.sp
The Sphinx core messages can also be translated on \X'tty: link https://www.transifex.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx-1/'\fI\%Transifex\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  There \fBtx\fP client tool,
which is provided by the \fBtransifex_client\fP Python package, can be used to
pull translations in \fB\&.po\fP format from Transifex.  To do this, go to
\fBsphinx/locale\fP and then run \fBtx pull \-f \-l LANG\fP where \fBLANG\fP is an
existing language identifier.  It is good practice to run
\fBpython babel_runner.py update\fP afterwards to make sure the \fB\&.po\fP file has the
canonical Babel formatting.
.SS Debugging tips
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Delete the build cache before building documents if you make changes in the
code by running the command \fBmake clean\fP or using the
\fI\%sphinx\-build \-E\fP option.
.IP \(bu 2
Use the \fI\%sphinx\-build \-P\fP option to run \fBpdb\fP on exceptions.
.IP \(bu 2
Use \fBnode.pformat()\fP and \fBnode.asdom().toxml()\fP to generate a printable
representation of the document structure.
.IP \(bu 2
Set the configuration variable \fI\%keep_warnings\fP to \fBTrue\fP so
warnings will be displayed in the generated output.
.IP \(bu 2
Set the configuration variable \fI\%nitpicky\fP to \fBTrue\fP so that Sphinx
will complain about references without a known target.
.IP \(bu 2
Set the debugging options in the \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/config.html'\fI\%Docutils configuration file\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.IP \(bu 2
JavaScript stemming algorithms in \fBsphinx/search/non\-minified\-js/*.js\fP
are generated using \X'tty: link https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball'\fI\%snowball\fP\X'tty: link'
by cloning the repository, executing \fBmake dist_libstemmer_js\fP and then
unpacking the tarball which is generated in \fBdist\fP directory.
.sp
Minified files in \fBsphinx/search/minified\-js/*.js\fP are generated from
non\-minified ones using \fBuglifyjs\fP (installed via npm), with \fB\-m\fP
option to enable mangling.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBsearchindex.js\fP files found in the \fBtests/js/fixtures/*\fP directories
are generated by using the standard Sphinx HTML builder on the corresponding
input projects found in \fBtests/js/roots/*\fP\&.  The fixtures provide test data
used by the Sphinx JavaScript unit tests, and can be regenerated by running
the \fButils/generate_js_fixtures.py\fP script.
.UNINDENT
.SS Sphinx\(aqs release process
.SS Versioning
.sp
Sphinx adheres to \X'tty: link https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/'\fI\%PEP 440\fP\X'tty: link' versions, with a \fBmajor.minor.micro\fP scheme for
the \fIrelease segment\fP (e.g. 1.2.3).
The major, minor, and micro version parts should be altered as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The major version part should be incremented for incompatible behavior change and
public API updates.
.IP \(bu 2
The minor version part should be incremented for most releases of Sphinx, where
backwards\-compatibility of API and features are preserves.
.IP \(bu 2
The micro version part should only be incremented for urgent bugfix\-only releases.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When the major version part is incremented, the minor and micro version parts
must be set to \fB0\fP\&.
When the minor version part is incremented, the micro version part must be set
to \fB0\fP\&.
.sp
New major versions should come with a beta\-testing period before the final
release.
.SS Deprecating a feature
.sp
There are a couple reasons that code in Sphinx might be deprecated:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If a feature has been improved or modified in a backwards\-incompatible way,
the old feature or behavior will be deprecated.
.IP \(bu 2
Sometimes Sphinx will include a backport of a Python library that\(aqs not
included in a version of Python that Sphinx currently supports. When Sphinx
no longer needs to support the older version of Python that doesn\(aqt include
the library, the library will be deprecated in Sphinx.
.UNINDENT
.sp
As the \fI\%Deprecation policy\fP describes, the first release of Sphinx that
deprecates a feature (\fBA.B\fP) should raise a \fBRemovedInSphinxXXWarning\fP
(where \fBXX\fP is the Sphinx version where the feature will be removed) when the
deprecated feature is invoked. Assuming we have good test coverage, these
warnings are converted to errors when running the test suite with warnings
enabled:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
pytest \-Wall
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Thus, when adding a \fBRemovedInSphinxXXWarning\fP you need to eliminate or
silence any warnings generated when running the tests.
.SS Deprecation policy
.sp
MAJOR and MINOR releases may deprecate certain features from previous
releases. If a feature is deprecated in a release A.x, it will continue to
work in all A.x.x versions (for all versions of x). It will continue to work
in all B.x.x versions but raise deprecation warnings. Deprecated features
will be removed at the C.0.0. It means the deprecated feature will work during
2 MAJOR releases at least.
.sp
So, for example, if we decided to start the deprecation of a function in
Sphinx 2.x:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Sphinx 2.x will contain a backwards\-compatible replica of the function
which will raise a \fBRemovedInSphinx40Warning\fP\&.
This is a subclass of \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PendingDeprecationWarning'\fI\%PendingDeprecationWarning\fP\X'tty: link', i.e. it
will not get displayed by default.
.IP \(bu 2
Sphinx 3.x will still contain the backwards\-compatible replica, but
\fBRemovedInSphinx40Warning\fP will be a subclass of
\X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning'\fI\%DeprecationWarning\fP\X'tty: link' then, and gets displayed by default.
.IP \(bu 2
Sphinx 4.0 will remove the feature outright.
.UNINDENT
.SS Deprecation warnings
.sp
Sphinx will enable its \fBRemovedInNextVersionWarning\fP warnings by default, if
\X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONWARNINGS'\fI\%PYTHONWARNINGS\fP\X'tty: link' is not set.  Therefore you can disable them
using:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPYTHONWARNINGS= make html\fP (Linux/Mac)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBexport PYTHONWARNINGS=\fP and do \fBmake html\fP (Linux/Mac)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset PYTHONWARNINGS=\fP and do \fBmake html\fP (Windows)
.UNINDENT
.sp
But you can also explicitly enable the pending ones using e.g.
\fBPYTHONWARNINGS=default\fP (see the \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#describing-warning-filters'\fI\%Python docs on configuring warnings\fP\X'tty: link') for more details.
.SS Python version support policy
.sp
Sphinx supports at all minor versions of Python released in the past 42 months
from the anticipated release date with a minimum of 3 minor versions of Python.
This policy is derived from \X'tty: link https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html'\fI\%NEP 29\fP\X'tty: link', a scientific Python domain standard.
.sp
For example, a version of Sphinx released in May 2024 would support Python 3.10,
3.11, and 3.12.

.SS Release procedures
.sp
The release procedures are listed in \fButils/release\-checklist.rst\fP\&.
.SS Organization of the Sphinx project
.sp
The guide explains how the Sphinx project is organized.
.SS Core developers
.sp
The core developers of Sphinx have write access to the main repository.  They
can commit changes, accept/reject pull requests, and manage items on the issue
tracker.
.SS Guidelines
.sp
The following are some general guidelines for core developers:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Questionable or extensive changes should be submitted as a pull request
instead of being committed directly to the main repository.  The pull
request should be reviewed by another core developer before it is merged.
.IP \(bu 2
Trivial changes can be committed directly but be sure to keep the repository
in a good working state and that all tests pass before pushing your changes.
.IP \(bu 2
When committing code written by someone else, please attribute the original
author in the commit message and any relevant \fBCHANGES.rst\fP entry.
.UNINDENT
.SS Membership
.sp
Core membership is predicated on continued active contribution to the project.
In general, prospective cores should demonstrate:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a good understanding of one of more components of Sphinx
.IP \(bu 2
a history of helpful, constructive contributions
.IP \(bu 2
a willingness to invest time improving Sphinx
.UNINDENT
.sp
Refer to \fI\%Contributing to Sphinx\fP for more information on how you can get started.
.SS Other contributors
.sp
You do not need to be a core developer or have write access to be involved in
the development of Sphinx.  You can submit patches or create pull requests
from forked repositories and have a core developer add the changes for you.
.sp
Similarly, contributions are not limited to code patches. We also welcome help
triaging bugs, input on design decisions, reviews of existing patches and
documentation improvements. More information can be found in
\fI\%Contributing to Sphinx\fP\&.
.sp
A list of people that have contributed to Sphinx can be found in
\fI\%Sphinx authors\fP\&.
.SS Sphinx Code of Conduct
.sp
Like the technical community as a whole, the Sphinx team and community is made
up of volunteers from all over the world.
Diversity is a strength, but it can also lead to communication issues and
unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to
adhere to.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBe friendly and patient.\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBe welcoming.\fP
We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all
backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of
any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status,
social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion,
and mental and physical ability.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBe considerate.\fP
Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
Remember that we\(aqre a world\-wide community, so you might not be communicating
in someone else\(aqs primary language.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBe respectful.\fP
Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and
then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
It\(aqs important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or
threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Sphinx community should be
respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the
Sphinx community.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBe careful in the words that you choose.\fP
We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment
and other exclusionary behavior aren\(aqt acceptable. This includes, but is not
limited to:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
Violent threats or language directed against another person.
.IP \(bu 2
Discriminatory jokes and language.
.IP \(bu 2
Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
.IP \(bu 2
Posting (or threatening to post) other people\(aqs personally identifying
information (\(dqdoxing\(dq).
.IP \(bu 2
Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
.IP \(bu 2
Unwelcome sexual attention.
.IP \(bu 2
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
.IP \(bu 2
Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then
stop.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fBWhen we disagree, try to understand why.\fP
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Sphinx is no
exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
constructively. Remember that we\(aqre different. Different people have different
perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a
viewpoint doesn\(aqt mean that they\(aqre wrong. Don\(aqt forget that it is human to
err and blaming each other doesn\(aqt get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping
to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This isn\(aqt an exhaustive list of things that you can\(aqt do.
Rather, take it in the spirit in which it\(aqs intended \- a guide to make it easier
to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.
This code of conduct applies to all spaces of the Sphinx community.

.SS Sphinx vs. Docutils
.sp
tl;dr: \fIdocutils\fP converts reStructuredText to multiple output formats. Sphinx
builds upon docutils to allow construction of cross\-referenced and indexed
bodies of documentation.
.sp
\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/'\fI\%docutils\fP\X'tty: link' is a text processing system for converting plain text
documentation into other, richer formats. As noted in the \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/dev/hacking.html'\fI\%docutils
documentation\fP\X'tty: link', docutils uses \fIreaders\fP to read a document, \fIparsers\fP for
parsing plain text formats into an internal tree representation made up of
different types of \fInodes\fP, and \fIwriters\fP to output this tree in various
document formats.  docutils provides parsers for one plain text format \-
\X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html'\fI\%reStructuredText\fP\X'tty: link' \- though other, \fIout\-of\-tree\fP parsers have been
implemented including Sphinx\(aqs \fI\%Markdown parser\fP\&. On the
other hand, it provides writers for many different formats including HTML,
LaTeX, man pages, Open Document Format and XML.
.sp
docutils exposes all of its functionality through a variety of \X'tty: link https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/tools.html'\fI\%front\-end
tools\fP\X'tty: link', such as \fBrst2html\fP, \fBrst2odt\fP and \fBrst2xml\fP\&. Crucially though,
all of these tools, and docutils itself, are concerned with individual
documents.  They don\(aqt support concepts such as cross\-referencing, indexing of
documents, or the construction of a document hierarchy (typically manifesting
in a table of contents).
.sp
Sphinx builds upon docutils by harnessing docutils\(aq readers and parsers and
providing its own \fI\%Builders\fP\&. As a result, Sphinx wraps some
of the \fIwriters\fP provided by docutils. This allows Sphinx to provide many
features that would simply not be possible with docutils, such as those
outlined above.
.SS Epub info
.sp
The following list gives some hints for the creation of epub files:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Split the text into several files. The longer the individual HTML files are,
the longer it takes the ebook reader to render them.  In extreme cases, the
rendering can take up to one minute.
.IP \(bu 2
Try to minimize the markup.  This also pays in rendering time.
.IP \(bu 2
For some readers you can use embedded or external fonts using the CSS
\fB@font\-face\fP directive.  This is \fIextremely\fP useful for code listings which
are often cut at the right margin.  The default Courier font (or variant) is
quite wide and you can only display up to 60 characters on a line.  If you
replace it with a narrower font, you can get more characters on a line.  You
may even use \X'tty: link https://fontforge.github.io/'\fI\%FontForge\fP\X'tty: link' and create
narrow variants of some free font.  In my case I get up to 70 characters on a
line.
.sp
You may have to experiment a little until you get reasonable results.
.IP \(bu 2
Test the created epubs. You can use several alternatives.  The ones I am aware
of are \X'tty: link https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck'\fI\%Epubcheck\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link https://calibre-ebook.com/'\fI\%Calibre\fP\X'tty: link', \X'tty: link https://fbreader.org/'\fI\%FBreader\fP\X'tty: link' (although it does not render the CSS),
and \X'tty: link https://www.oreilly.com/bookworm/index.html'\fI\%Bookworm\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  For Bookworm, you can download the source from
\X'tty: link https://code.google.com/archive/p/threepress'\fI\%https://code.google.com/archive/p/threepress\fP\X'tty: link' and run your own local server.
.IP \(bu 2
Large floating divs are not displayed properly.
If they cover more than one page, the div is only shown on the first page.
In that case you can copy the \fBepub.css\fP from the
\fBsphinx/themes/epub/static/\fP directory to your local \fB_static/\fP
directory and remove the float settings.
.IP \(bu 2
Files that are inserted outside of the \fBtoctree\fP directive must be manually
included. This sometimes applies to appendixes, e.g. the glossary or
the indices.  You can add them with the \fI\%epub_post_files\fP option.
.IP \(bu 2
The handling of the epub cover page differs from the reStructuredText
procedure which automatically resolves image paths and puts the images
into the \fB_images\fP directory.  For the epub cover page put the image in the
\fI\%html_static_path\fP directory and reference it with its full path in
the \fI\%epub_cover\fP config option.
.IP \(bu 2
\X'tty: link https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211'\fI\%kindlegen\fP\X'tty: link' command can convert from epub3 resulting file to \fB\&.mobi\fP file
for Kindle. You can get \fByourdoc.mobi\fP under \fB_build/epub\fP after the
following command:
.INDENT 2.0

.SS Texinfo info
.sp
There are two main programs for reading Info files, \fBinfo\fP and GNU Emacs.  The
\fBinfo\fP program has less features but is available in most Unix environments
and can be quickly accessed from the terminal.  Emacs provides better font and
color display and supports extensive customization (of course).
.SS Displaying Links
.sp
One noticeable problem you may encounter with the generated Info files is how
references are displayed.  If you read the source of an Info file, a reference
to this section would look like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
* note Displaying Links: target\-id
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the stand\-alone reader, \fBinfo\fP, references are displayed just as they
appear in the source.  Emacs, on the other\-hand, will by default replace
\fB*note:\fP with \fBsee\fP and hide the \fBtarget\-id\fP\&.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fI\%Displaying Links\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
One can disable generation of the inline references in a document
with \fI\%texinfo_cross_references\fP\&.  That makes
an info file more readable with stand\-alone reader (\fBinfo\fP).
.sp
The exact behavior of how Emacs displays references is dependent on the variable
\fBInfo\-hide\-note\-references\fP\&.  If set to the value of \fBhide\fP, Emacs will hide
both the \fB*note:\fP part and the \fBtarget\-id\fP\&.  This is generally the best way
to view Sphinx\-based documents since they often make frequent use of links and
do not take this limitation into account.  However, changing this variable
affects how all Info documents are displayed and most do take this behavior
into account.
.sp
If you want Emacs to display Info files produced by Sphinx using the value
\fBhide\fP for \fBInfo\-hide\-note\-references\fP and the default value for all other
Info files, try adding the following Emacs Lisp code to your start\-up file,
\fB~/.emacs.d/init.el\fP\&.

\fBsphinx\-build\fP can create documentation in different formats.  A
format is selected by specifying the builder name on the command line; it
defaults to HTML.  Builders can also perform other tasks related to
documentation processing.  For a list of available builders, refer to
\fI\%Builders\fP\&.

.SS Glossary
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B builder
A class (inheriting from \fI\%Builder\fP) that takes
parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders
translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to
use builders that e.g. check for broken links in the documentation, or
build coverage information.
.sp
See \fI\%Builders\fP for an overview over Sphinx\(aqs built\-in
builders.
.TP
.B configuration directory
The directory containing \fBconf.py\fP\&.  By default, this is the same as
the \fI\%source directory\fP, but can be set differently with the \fB\-c\fP
command\-line option.
.TP
.B directive
A reStructuredText markup element that allows marking a block of content
with special meaning.  Directives are supplied not only by docutils, but
Sphinx and custom extensions can add their own.  The basic directive
syntax looks like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
\&.. directivename:: argument ...
   :option: value

   Content of the directive.
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
See \fI\%Directives\fP for more information.
.TP
.B document name
Since reST source files can have different extensions (some people like
\fB\&.txt\fP, some like \fB\&.rst\fP \-\- the extension can be configured with
\fI\%source_suffix\fP) and different OSes have different path
separators, Sphinx abstracts them: \fIdocument names\fP are always
relative to the \fI\%source directory\fP, the extension is stripped, and
path separators are converted to slashes.  All values, parameters and such
referring to \(dqdocuments\(dq expect such document names.
.sp
Examples for document names are \fBindex\fP, \fBlibrary/zipfile\fP, or
\fBreference/datamodel/types\fP\&.  Note that there is no leading or trailing
slash.
.TP
.B domain
A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText \fI\%directive\fPs
and \fI\%role\fPs) to describe and link to \fI\%object\fPs belonging
together, e.g. elements of a programming language.  Directive and role
names in a domain have names like \fBdomain:name\fP, e.g. \fBpy:function\fP\&.
.sp
Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of
documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also
means that extensions that support the documentation of whole new
languages are much easier to write.
.sp
For more information, refer to \fI\%Domains\fP\&.
.TP
.B environment
A structure where information about all documents under the root is saved,
and used for cross\-referencing.  The environment is pickled after the
parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read and parse new and
changed documents.
.TP
.B extension
A custom \fI\%role\fP, \fI\%directive\fP or other aspect of Sphinx that
allows users to modify any aspect of the build process within Sphinx.
.sp
For more information, refer to \fI\%Extensions\fP\&.
.TP
.B master document
The document that contains the root \fI\%toctree\fP directive.
.TP
.B root document
Same as \fI\%master document\fP\&.
.TP
.B object
The basic building block of Sphinx documentation.  Every \(dqobject
directive\(dq (e.g. \fI\%py:function\fP or \fI\%object\fP) creates such
a block; and most objects can be cross\-referenced to.
.TP
.B RemoveInSphinxXXXWarning
The feature which is warned will be removed in Sphinx\-XXX version.
It usually caused from Sphinx extensions which is using deprecated.
See also \fI\%Deprecation Warnings\fP\&.
.TP
.B role
A reStructuredText markup element that allows marking a piece of text.
Like directives, roles are extensible.  The basic syntax looks like this:
\fB:rolename:\(gacontent\(ga\fP\&.  See \fI\%Inline markup\fP for details.
.TP
.B source directory
The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all source
files for one Sphinx project.
.TP
.B reStructuredText
An easy\-to\-read, what\-you\-see\-is\-what\-you\-get plaintext markup syntax and
parser system.

These frameworks are no longer be automatically injected into themes from
Sphinx 6.0. If you develop a theme or extension that uses the
\fBjQuery\fP, \fB$\fP, or \fB$u\fP global objects, you need to update your
JavaScript to modern standards, or use the mitigation below.

The first option is to use the \X'tty: link https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/jquery/'\fI\%sphinxcontrib.jquery\fP\X'tty: link' extension, which has been
developed by the Sphinx team and contributors. To use this, add

The second option is to manually ensure that the frameworks are present.
To re\-add jQuery and underscore.js, you will need to copy \fBjquery.js\fP and
\fBunderscore.js\fP from \X'tty: link https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/tree/v5.3.0/sphinx/themes/basic/static'\fI\%the Sphinx repository\fP\X'tty: link' to your \fBstatic\fP directory,

.SS Incompatible changes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Jinja, the template engine used for the default HTML templates, is now
no longer shipped with Sphinx.  If it is not installed automatically for
you (it is now listed as a dependency in \fBsetup.py\fP), install it manually
from PyPI.  This will also be needed if you\(aqre using Sphinx from a SVN
checkout; in that case please also remove the \fBsphinx/jinja\fP directory
that may be left over from old revisions.
.IP \(bu 2
The clumsy handling of the \fBindex.html\fP template was removed.  The config
value \fBhtml_index\fP is gone, and \fBhtml_additional_pages\fP should be used
instead.  If you need it, the old \fBindex.html\fP template is still there,
called \fBdefindex.html\fP, and you can port your html_index template, using
Jinja inheritance, by changing your template:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
{% extends \(dqdefindex.html\(dq %}
{% block tables %}
\&... old html_index template content ...
{% endblock %}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and putting \fB\(aqindex\(aq: name of your template\fP in \fBhtml_additional_pages\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
In the layout template, redundant \fBblock\fPs were removed; you should use
Jinja\(aqs standard \fB{{ super() }}\fP mechanism instead, as explained in the
(newly written) templating docs.

Extension API (Application object):
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2

\fBadd_description_unit\fP but the directive will only create a target
and no output.
.IP \(bu 2
Support a new method, \fBadd_transform\fP\&.  It takes a standard Docutils
\fBTransform\fP subclass which is then applied by Sphinx\(aqs reader on
parsing reST document trees.
.IP \(bu 2
Add support for other template engines than Jinja, by adding an
abstraction called a \(dqtemplate bridge\(dq.  This class handles rendering
of templates and can be changed using the new configuration value
\(dqtemplate_bridge\(dq.

The config file itself can be an extension (if it provides a \fBsetup()\fP
function).

There\(aqs a new config value, \fBhtml_title\fP, that controls the overall
\(dqtitle\(dq of the set of Sphinx docs.  It is used instead everywhere instead of
\(dqProjectname vX.Y documentation\(dq now.
.IP \(bu 2
All references to \(dqdocumentation\(dq in the templates have been removed, so
that it is now easier to use Sphinx for non\-documentation documents with
the default templates.
.IP \(bu 2
Templates now have an XHTML doctype, to be consistent with Docutils\(aq
HTML output.
.IP \(bu 2
You can now create an OpenSearch description file with the
\fBhtml_use_opensearch\fP config value.
.IP \(bu 2
You can now quickly include a logo in the sidebar, using the \fBhtml_logo\fP
config value.

There are new blocks in the sidebar, so that you can easily insert content
into the sidebar.
