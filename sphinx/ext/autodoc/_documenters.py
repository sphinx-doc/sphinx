class Documenter:
    """A Documenter knows how to autodocument a single object type.  When
    registered with the AutoDirective, it will be used to document objects
    of that type when needed by autodoc.

    Its *objtype* attribute selects what auto directive it is assigned to
    (the directive name is 'auto' + objtype), and what directive it generates
    by default, though that can be overridden by an attribute called
    *directivetype*.

    A Documenter has an *option_spec* that works like a docutils directive's;
    in fact, it will be used to parse an auto directive's options that matches
    the Documenter.
