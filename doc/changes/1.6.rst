=====================================

Dependencies
------------

1.6b1

* (updated) latex output is tested with Ubuntu trusty's texlive packages (Feb.
  2014) and earlier tex installations may not be fully compliant, particularly
  regarding Unicode engines xelatex and lualatex
* (added) latexmk is required for ``make latexpdf`` on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X
  (refs: #3082)

Incompatible changes
--------------------

1.6b1

* #1061, #2336, #3235: Now generation of autosummary doesn't contain imported
  members by default. Thanks to Luc Saffre.
* LaTeX ``\includegraphics`` command isn't overloaded: only
  ``\sphinxincludegraphics`` has the custom code to fit image to available width
  if oversized.
* The subclasses of ``sphinx.domains.Index`` should override ``generate()``
  method.  The default implementation raises NotImplementedError
* LaTeX positioned long tables horizontally centered, and short ones
  flushed left (no text flow around table.) The position now defaults to center
  in both cases, and it will obey Docutils 0.13 ``:align:`` option (refs #3415,
  #3377)
* option directive also allows all punctuations for the option name (refs:
  #3366)
* #3413: if :rst:dir:`literalinclude`'s ``:start-after:`` is used, make
  ``:lines:`` relative (refs #3412)
* ``literalinclude`` directive does not allow the combination of ``:diff:``
  option and other options (refs: #3416)
* LuaLaTeX engine uses ``fontspec`` like XeLaTeX. It is advised ``latex_engine
  = 'lualatex'`` be used only on up-to-date TeX installs (refs #3070, #3466)
* :confval:`!latex_keep_old_macro_names` default value has been changed from
  ``True`` to ``False``. This means that some LaTeX macros for styling are
  by default defined only with ``\sphinx..`` prefixed names. (refs: #3429)
* Footer "Continued on next page" of LaTeX longtable's now not framed (refs:
  #3497)
* #3529: The arguments of ``BuildEnvironment.__init__`` is changed
* #3082: Use latexmk for pdf (and dvi) targets (Unix-like platforms only)
* #3558: Emit warnings if footnotes and citations are not referenced.  The
  warnings can be suppressed by ``suppress_warnings``.
* latex made available (non documented) colour macros from a file distributed
  with pdftex engine for Plain TeX. This is removed in order to provide better
  support for multiple TeX engines. Only interface from ``color`` or
  ``xcolor`` packages should be used by extensions of Sphinx latex writer.
  (refs #3550)
* ``Builder.env`` is not filled at instantiation
* #3594: LaTeX: single raw directive has been considered as block level element
* #3639: If ``html_experimental_html5_writer`` is available, epub builder use it
  by default.
* ``Sphinx.add_source_parser()`` raises an error if duplicated
