  for general index.  Make sure your LaTeX distribution includes it.
  (refs: #5134)
* LaTeX: ``latexmk`` is required for ``make latexpdf`` on Windows

Incompatible changes

  preferentially

  directory of the document being built instead of in the root directory of

  version of its env data structure as metadata.  In detail, please see

  changed from ``'unknown'`` to the value of :confval:`author`.  This is same as
  a ``conf.py`` file sphinx-build generates.
* The ``gettext_compact`` attribute is removed from ``document.settings``
  object.  Please use ``config.gettext_compact`` instead.
* The processing order on reading phase is changed.  smart_quotes, sphinx
  domains, :event:`doctree-read` event and versioning doctrees are invoked
  earlier than so far. For more details, please read a description of
  :py:meth:`.Sphinx.add_transform()`
* #4827: All ``substitution_definition`` nodes are removed from doctree on
  reading phase

  citations
* #4648: latex: Now "rubric" elements are rendered as unnumbered section title

* LaTeX: with lualatex or xelatex use by default :program:`xindy` as
  UTF-8 able replacement of :program:`makeindex` (refs: #5134).  After
  upgrading Sphinx, please clean latex build repertory of existing project
  before new build.
* #5163: html: hlist items are now aligned to top
* ``highlightlang`` directive is processed on resolving phase
* #4000: LaTeX: template changed.  Following elements moved to it:
