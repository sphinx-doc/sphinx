Sphinx Extensions
=================

Since many projects will need special features in their documentation, Sphinx
allows to add "extensions" to the build process, each of which can modify almost
any aspect of document processing.

This chapter describes the extensions bundled with Sphinx.  For the API
documentation on writing your own extension, see :ref:`dev-extensions`.
