``sphinx.ext.linkcode`` API
===========================

Refer to :mod:`sphinx.ext.linkcode` for more information about the
extension and its configuration.

Builder API
-----------

.. class:: MyAwesomeBuilder

   .. attribute:: supported_linkcode

      The linkcode extension, by default, will only inject references
      for an ``html`` builder. If a non-html builder wishes to support
      managing references generated by linkcode, the
      ``supported_linkcode`` attribute can be defined in the builder's
      implementation. The expected value for this attribute is an
      expression which is compatible with :rst:dir:`only`.

      For example, if a builder was named ``my-awesome-builder``, the
      following can be used:

      .. code-block:: python

         class MyAwesomeBuilder(Builder):
             supported_linkcode = 'my-awesome-builder'
             ...
