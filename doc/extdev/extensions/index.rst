=======================
Built-in extensions API
=======================

Sphinx includes several :ref:`built-in extensions <builtin-extensions>`,
which third-party extensions may wish to integrate with. This chapter
describes the extensions bundled with Sphinx which provide an API which
other extensions may interface with.

For the API documentation on writing your own extension, refer to
:ref:`dev-extensions`.
