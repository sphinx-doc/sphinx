The Sphinx testing plugin
=========================

The testing plugin can be enabled by adding following line in  ``conftest.py``:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: conftest.py

   pytest_plugins = ['sphinx.testing.fixtures']

This rest of the section is dedicated to documenting the testing features but
the reader is assumed to have some prior knowledge on `pytest`_.

.. warning::

   This topic is incomplete and some features are not yet documented.

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/
