.. note::

   **Historical context**: Web Support originated from the `Pocoo`_ community,
   the original creators of Sphinx, Jinja, Flask, Pygments, and more. Web
   Support was part of a plan to create a forum application that tied together
   Jinja, Flask, Sphinx, etc. The core goal behind Web Support was to enable a
   user editing and suggestion layer on top of documentation. While the concept
   has merit, the feature has seen limited adoption and development over the
   years. As of 2025, there are few real-world examples of its use. See
   `sphinx-websupport-app`_ for one such example.
