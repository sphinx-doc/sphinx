================

reStructuredText (reST) is the default plaintext markup language used by both
Docutils and Sphinx. Docutils provides the basic reStructuredText syntax, while
Sphinx extends this to support additional functionality.

The below guides go through the most important aspects of reST. For the
authoritative reStructuredText reference, refer to the `docutils
documentation`__.
