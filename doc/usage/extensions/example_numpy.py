"""Example NumPy style docstrings.

This module demonstrates documentation as specified by the `NumPy
Documentation HOWTO`_. Docstrings may extend over multiple lines. Sections
are created with a section header followed by an underline of equal length.

Example
-------
Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
literal blocks::

    $ python example_numpy.py


Section breaks are created with two blank lines. Section breaks are also
implicitly created anytime a new section starts. Section bodies *may* be
indented:

Notes
-----
    This is an example of an indented section. It's like any other section,
    but the body is indented to help it stand out from surrounding text.

If a section is indented, then a section break is created by
resuming unindented text.

Attributes
----------
module_level_variable1 : int
    Module level variables may be documented in either the ``Attributes``
    section of the module docstring, or in an inline docstring immediately
    following the variable.

    Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose
    one convention to document module level variables and be consistent
    with it.

    Function parameters should be documented in the ``Parameters`` section.
    The name of each parameter is required. The type and description of each
    parameter is optional, but should be included if not obvious.

    If ``*args`` or ``**kwargs`` are accepted,
    they should be listed as ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``.

    The format for a parameter is::

        name : type
            description

            The description may span multiple lines. Following lines
            should be indented to match the first line of the description.

            descriptions.

    ----------

    *args

    **kwargs
        Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if successful, False otherwise.

        The return type is not optional. The ``Returns`` section may span
        multiple lines and paragraphs. Following lines should be indented to

    ------
    AttributeError
